title: " On Data Efficiency of Meta-learning "
abstract: " Meta-learning has enabled learning statistical models that can be quickly
  adapted to new prediction tasks. Motivated by use-cases in personalized federated
  learning, we study the often overlooked aspect of the modern meta-learning algorithmsâ€”their
  data efficiency. To shed more light on which methods are more efficient, we use
  techniques from algorithmic stability to derive bounds on the transfer risk that
  have important practical implications, indicating how much supervision is needed
  and how it must be allocated for each method to attain the desired level of generalization.
  Further, we introduce a new simple framework for evaluating meta-learning methods
  under a limit on the available supervision, conduct an empirical study of MAML,
  Reptile, andProtoNets, and demonstrate the differences in the behavior of these
  methods on few-shot and federated learning benchmarks. Finally, we propose active
  meta-learning, which incorporates active data selection into learning-to-learn,
  leading to better performance of all methods in the limited supervision regime. "
