title: " Mean-Variance Analysis in Bayesian Optimization under Uncertainty "
abstract: " We consider active learning (AL) in an uncertain environment in which
  trade-off between multiple risk measures need to be considered. As an AL problem
  in such an uncertain environment, we study Mean-Variance Analysis in Bayesian Optimization
  (MVA-BO) setting. Mean-variance analysis was developed in the field of financial
  engineering and has been used to make decisions that take into account the trade-off
  between the average and variance of investment uncertainty. In this paper, we specifically
  focus on BO setting with an uncertain component and consider multi-task, multi-objective,
  and constrained optimization scenarios for the mean-variance trade-off of the uncertain
  component. When the target blackbox function is modeled by Gaussian Process (GP),
  we derive the bounds of the two risk measures and propose AL algorithm for each
  of the above three scenarios based on the risk measure bounds. We show the effectiveness
  of the proposed AL algorithms through theoretical analysis and numerical experiments. "
