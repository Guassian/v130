title: " False Discovery Rates in Biological Networks "
abstract: " The increasing availability of data has generated unprecedented prospects
  for network analyses in many biological fields, such as neuroscience (e.g., brain
  networks), genomics (e.g., gene-gene interaction networks), and ecology (e.g., species
  interaction networks). A powerful statistical framework for estimating such networks
  is Gaussian graphical models, but standard estimators for the corresponding graphs
  are prone to large numbers of false discoveries. In this paper, we introduce a novel
  graph estimator based on knockoffs that imitate the partial correlation structures
  of unconnected nodes. We then show that this new estimator provides accurate control
  of the false discovery rate and yet large power. "
