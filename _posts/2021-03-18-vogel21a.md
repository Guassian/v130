title: " Learning Fair Scoring Functions: Bipartite Ranking under ROC-based Fairness
  Constraints "
abstract: " Many applications of AI involve scoring individuals using a learned function
  of their attributes. These predictive risk scores are then used to take decisions
  based on whether the score exceeds a certain threshold, which may vary depending
  on the context. The level of delegation granted to such systems in critical applications
  like credit lending and medical diagnosis will heavily depend on how questions of
  fairness can be answered. In this paper, we study fairness for the problem of learning
  scoring functions from binary labeled data, a classic learning task known as bipartite
  ranking. We argue that the functional nature of the ROC curve, the gold standard
  measure of ranking accuracy in this context, leads to several ways of formulating
  fairness constraints. We introduce general families of fairness definitions based
  on the AUC and on ROC curves, and show that our ROC-based constraints can be instantiated
  such that classifiers obtained by thresholding the scoring function satisfy classification
  fairness for a desired range of thresholds. We establish generalization bounds for
  scoring functions learned under such constraints, design practical learning algorithms
  and show the relevance our approach with numerical experiments on real and synthetic
  data. "
