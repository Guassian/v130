title: " Convergence of  Gaussian-smoothed optimal transport distance with sub-gamma
  distributions and  dependent samples "
abstract: " The Gaussian-smoothed optimal transport (GOT) framework, recently proposed
  by Goldfeld et al., scales to high dimensions in estimation and provides an alternative
  to entropy regularization. This paper provides convergence guarantees for estimating
  the GOT distance under more general settings. For the Gaussian-smoothed $p$-Wasserstein
  distance in $d$ dimensions, our results require only the existence of a moment greater
  than $d + 2p$. For the special case of sub-gamma distributions, we quantify the
  dependence on the dimension $d$ and establish a phase transition with respect to
  the scale parameter. We also prove convergence for dependent samples, only requiring
  a condition on the pairwise dependence of the samples measured by the covariance
  of the feature map of a kernel space. A key step in our analysis is to show that
  the GOT distance is dominated by a family of kernel maximum mean discrepancy (MMD)
  distances with a kernel that depends on the cost function as well as the amount
  of Gaussian smoothing. This insight provides further interpretability for the GOT
  framework and also introduces a class of kernel MMD distances with desirable properties.
  The theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments.The Gaussian-smoothed
