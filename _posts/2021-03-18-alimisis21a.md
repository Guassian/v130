title: " Momentum Improves Optimization on Riemannian Manifolds "
abstract: " We develop a new Riemannian descent algorithm that relies on momentum
  to improve over existing first-order methods for geodesically convex optimization.
  In contrast, accelerated convergence rates proved in prior work have only been shown
  to hold for geodesically strongly-convex objective functions. We further extend
  our algorithm to geodesically weakly-quasi-convex objectives. Our proofs of convergence
  rely on a novel estimate sequence that illustrates the dependency of the convergence
  rate on the curvature of the manifold. We validate our theoretical results empirically
  on several optimization problems defined on the sphere and on the manifold of positive
  definite matrices. "
