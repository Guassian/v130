title: " Differentially Private Analysis on Graph Streams "
abstract: " In this paper, we focus on answering queries, in a differentially private
  manner, on graph streams. We adopt the sliding window model of privacy, where we
  wish to perform analysis on the last $W$ updates and ensure that privacy is preserved
  for the entire stream. We show that in this model, the price of ensuring differential
  privacy is minimal. Furthermore, since differential privacy is preserved under post-processing,
  our results can be used as a subroutine in many tasks, including Lipschitz learning
  on graphs, cut functions, and spectral clustering. "
