title: " Dominate or Delete: Decentralized Competing Bandits in Serial Dictatorship "
abstract: " Online learning in a two-sided matching market, with demand side agents
  continuously competing to be matched with supply side (arms), abstracts the complex
  interactions under partial information on matching platforms (e.g. UpWork, TaskRabbit).
  We study the decentralized serial dictatorship setting, a two-sided matching market
  where the demand side agents have unknown and heterogeneous valuation over the supply
  side (arms), while the arms have known uniform preference over the demand side (agents).
  We design the first decentralized algorithm - UCB with Decentralized Dominant-arm
  Deletion (UCB-D3), for the agents, that does not require any knowledge of reward
  gaps or time horizon. UCB-D3 works in phases, where in each phase, agents delete
  dominated arms â€“ the arms preferred by higher ranked agents, and play only from
  the non-dominated arms according to the UCB. At the end of the phase, agents broadcast
  in a decentralized fashion, their estimated preferred arms through pure exploitation.
  We prove a new regret lower bound for the decentralized serial dictatorship model,
  and prove that UCB-D3 achieves order optimal regret guarantee. "
