title: " Direct-Search for a Class of Stochastic Min-Max Problems "
abstract: " Recent applications in machine learning have renewed the interest of the
  community in min-max optimization problems. While gradient-based optimization methods
  are widely used to solve such problems, there are however many scenarios where these
  techniques are not well-suited, or even not applicable when the gradient is not
  accessible. We investigate the use of direct-search methods that belong to a class
  of derivative-free techniques that only access the objective function through an
  oracle. In this work, we design a novel algorithm in the context of min-max saddle
  point games where one sequentially updates the min and the max player. We prove
  convergence of this algorithm under mild assumptions, where the objective of the
  max-player satisfies the Polyak-≈Å{}ojasiewicz (PL) condition, while the min-player
  is characterized by a nonconvex objective. Our method only assumes dynamically adjusted
  accurate estimates of the oracle with a fixed probability. To the best of our knowledge,
  our analysis is the first one to address the convergence of a direct-search method
  for min-max objectives in a stochastic setting. "
