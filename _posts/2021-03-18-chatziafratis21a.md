title: " Maximizing Agreements for Ranking, Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering
  via MAX-CUT "
abstract: " In this paper, we study a number of well-known combinatorial optimization
  problems that fit in the following paradigm: the input is a collection of (potentially
  inconsistent) local relationships between the elements of a ground set (e.g., pairwise
  comparisons, similar/dissimilar pairs, or ancestry structure of triples of points),
  and the goal is to aggregate this information into a global structure (e.g., a ranking,
  a clustering, or a hierarchical clustering) in a way that maximizes agreement with
  the input. Well-studied problems such as rank aggregation, correlation clustering,
  and hierarchical clustering with triplet constraints fall in this class of problems.
  We study these problems on stochastic instances with a hidden embedded ground truth
  solution. Our main algorithmic contribution is a unified technique that uses the
  maximum cut problem in graphs to approximately solve these problems. Using this
  technique, we can often get approximation guarantees in the stochastic setting that
  are better than the known worst case inapproximability bounds for the corresponding
  problem. On the negative side, we improve the worst case inapproximability bound
  on several hierarchical clustering formulations through a reduction to related ranking
  problems. "
