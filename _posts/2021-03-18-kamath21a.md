title: " Does Invariant Risk Minimization Capture Invariance? "
abstract: ' We show that the Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) formulation of Arjovsky
  et al. (2019) can fail to capture "natural" invariances, at least when used in its
  practical "linear" form, and even on very simple problems which directly follow
  the motivating examples for IRM. This can lead to worse generalization on new environments,
  even when compared to unconstrained ERM. The issue stems from a significant gap
  between the linear variant (as in their concrete method IRMv1) and the full non-linear
  IRM formulation. Additionally, even when capturing the "right" invariances, we show
  that it is possible for IRM to learn a sub-optimal predictor, due to the loss function
  not being invariant across environments. The issues arise even when measuring invariance
  on the population distributions, but are exacerbated by the fact that IRM is extremely
  fragile to sampling. '
