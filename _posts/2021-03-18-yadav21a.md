title: " Faster Kernel Interpolation for Gaussian Processes "
abstract: " A key challenge in scaling Gaussian Process (GP) regression to massive
  datasets is that exact inference requires computation with a dense n × n kernel
  matrix, where n is the number of data points. Significant work focuses on approximating
  the kernel matrix via interpolation using a smaller set of m “inducing points”.
  Structured kernel interpolation (SKI) is among the most scalable methods: by placing
  inducing points on a dense grid and using structured matrix algebra, SKI achieves
  per-iteration time of O(n + m log m) for approximate inference. This linear scaling
  in n enables approximate inference for very large data sets; however, the cost is
  per-iteration, which remains a limitation for extremely large n. We show that the
  SKI per-iteration time can be reduced to O(m log m) after a single O(n) time precomputation
  step by reframing SKI as solving a natural Bayesian linear regression problem with
  a fixed set of m compact basis functions. For a fixed grid, our new method scales
  to truly massive data sets: after the initial linear time pass, all subsequent computations
  are independent of n. We demonstrate speedups in practice for a wide range of m
  and n and for all the main GP inference tasks. With per-iteration complexity independent
  of the dataset size n for a fixed grid, our method scales to truly massive data
  sets. We demonstrate speedups in practice for a wide range of m and n and apply
  the method to GP inference on a three-dimensional weather radar dataset with over
  100 million points. "
