title: " Provably Eﬃcient Actor-Critic for Risk-Sensitive and Robust Adversarial RL:
  A Linear-Quadratic Case "
abstract: " Risk-sensitivity plays a central role in artiﬁcial intelligence safety.
  In this paper, we study the global convergence of the actor-critic algorithm for
  risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RSRL) with exponential utility, which remains
  challenging for policy optimization as it lacks the linearity needed to formulate
  policy gradient. To bypass such an issue of nonlinearity, we resort to the equivalence
  between RSRL and robust adversarial reinforcement learning (RARL), which is formulated
  as a zero-sum Markov game with a hypothetical adversary. In particular, the Nash
  equilibrium (NE) of such a game yields the optimal policy for RSRL, which is provably
  robust. We focus on a simple yet fundamental setting known as linear-quadratic (LQ)
  game. To attain the optimal policy, we develop a nested natural actor-critic algorithm,
  which provably converges to the NE of the LQ game at a sublinear rate, thus solving
  both RSRL and RARL. To the best knowledge, the proposed nested actor-critic algorithm
  appears to be the ﬁrst model-free policy optimization algorithm that provably attains
  the optimal policy for RSRL and RARL in the LQ setting, which sheds light on more
  general settings. "
