title: " Efficient Interpolation of Density Estimators "
abstract: " We study the problem of space and time efficient evaluation of a nonparametric
  estimator that approximates an unknown density. In the regime where consistent estimation
  is possible, we use a piecewise multivariate polynomial interpolation scheme to
  give a computationally efficient construction that converts the original estimator
  to a new estimator that can be queried efficiently and has low space requirements,
  all without adversely deteriorating the original approximation quality. Our result
  gives a new statistical perspective on the problem of fast evaluation of kernel
  density estimators in the presence of underlying smoothness. As a corollary, we
  give a succinct derivation of a classical result of Kolmogorovâ€”Tikhomirov on the
  metric entropy of Holder classes of smooth functions. "
