title: " Matérn Gaussian Processes on Graphs "
abstract: " Gaussian processes are a versatile framework for learning unknown functions
  in a manner that permits one to utilize prior information about their properties.
  Although many different Gaussian process models are readily available when the input
  space is Euclidean, the choice is much more limited for Gaussian processes whose
  input space is an undirected graph. In this work, we leverage the stochastic partial
  differential equation characterization of Matérn Gaussian processes—a widely-used
  model class in the Euclidean setting—to study their analog for undirected graphs.
  We show that the resulting Gaussian processes inherit various attractive properties
  of their Euclidean and Riemannian analogs and provide techniques that allow them
  to be trained using standard methods, such as inducing points. This enables graph
  Matérn Gaussian processes to be employed in mini-batch and non-conjugate settings,
  thereby making them more accessible to practitioners and easier to deploy within
  larger learning frameworks. "
