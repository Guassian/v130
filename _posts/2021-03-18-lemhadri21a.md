title: " LassoNet: Neural Networks with Feature Sparsity "
abstract: " Much work has been done recently to make neural networks more interpretable,
  and one approach is to arrange for the network to use only a subset of the available
  features. In linear models, Lasso (or $\\ell_1$-regularized) regression assigns
  zero weights to the most irrelevant or redundant features, and is widely used in
  data science. However the Lasso only applies to linear models. Here we introduce
  LassoNet, a neural network framework with global feature selection. Our approach
  achieves feature sparsity by allowing a feature to participate in a hidden unit
  only if its linear representative is active. Unlike other approaches to feature
  selection for neural nets, our method uses a modified objective function with constraints,
  and so integrates feature selection with the parameter learning directly. As a result,
  it delivers an entire regularization path of solutions with a range of feature sparsity.
  In experiments with real and simulated data, LassoNet significantly outperforms
  state-of-the-art methods for feature selection and regression. The LassoNet method
  uses projected proximal gradient descent, and generalizes directly to deep networks.
  It can be implemented by adding just a few lines of code to a standard neural network. "
