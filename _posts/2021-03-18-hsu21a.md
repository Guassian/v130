title: " On the proliferation of support vectors in high dimensions "
abstract: " The support vector machine (SVM) is a well-established classification
  method whose name refers to the particular training examples, called support vectors,
  that determine the maximum margin separating hyperplane. The SVM classifier is known
  to enjoy good generalization properties when the number of support vectors is small
  compared to the number of training examples. However, recent research has shown
  that in sufficiently high-dimensional linear classification problems, the SVM can
  generalize well despite a proliferation of support vectors where all training examples
  are support vectors. In this paper, we identify new deterministic equivalences for
  this phenomenon of support vector proliferation, and use them to (1) substantially
  broaden the conditions under which the phenomenon occurs in high-dimensional settings,
  and (2) prove a nearly matching converse result. "
