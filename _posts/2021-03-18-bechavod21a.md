title: " Gaming Helps! Learning from Strategic Interactions in Natural Dynamics "
abstract: " We consider an online regression setting in which individuals adapt to
  the regression model: arriving individuals may access the model throughout the process,
  and invest strategically in modifying their own features so as to improve their
  predicted score. Such feature manipulation, or “gaming”, has been observed in various
  scenarios—from credit assessment to school admissions, posing a challenge for the
  learner. Surprisingly, we find that such strategic manipulation may in fact help
  the learner recover the meaningful variables in settings where an agent can invest
  in improving meaningful features—that is, the features that, when changed, affect
  the true label, as opposed to non-meaningful features that have no effect. We show
  that even simple behavior on the learner’s part allows her to simultaneously i)
  accurately recover the meaningful features, and ii) incentivize agents to invest
  in these meaningful features, providing incentives for improvement. "
