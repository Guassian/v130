title: " Shuffled Model of Differential Privacy in Federated Learning "
abstract: " We consider a distributed empirical risk minimization (ERM) optimization
  problem with communication efficiency and privacy requirements, motivated by the
  federated learning (FL) framework. We propose a distributed communication-efficient
  and local differentially private stochastic gradient descent (CLDP-SGD) algorithm
  and analyze its communication, privacy, and convergence trade-offs. Since each iteration
  of the CLDP-SGD aggregates the client-side local gradients, we develop (optimal)
  communication-efficient schemes for mean estimation for several $\\ell_p$ spaces
  under local differential privacy (LDP). To overcome performance limitation of LDP,
  CLDP-SGD takes advantage of the inherent privacy amplification provided by client
  subsampling and data subsampling at each selected client (through SGD) as well as
  the recently developed shuffled model of privacy. For convex loss functions, we
  prove that the proposed CLDP-SGD algorithm matches the known lower bounds on the
  \\textit{centralized} private ERM while using a finite number of bits per iteration
  for each client, \\emph{i.e.,} effectively getting communication efficiency for
  “free”. We also provide preliminary experimental results supporting the theory. "
