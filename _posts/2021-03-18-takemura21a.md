title: " A Parameter-Free Algorithm for Misspecified Linear Contextual Bandits "
abstract: " We investigate the misspecified linear contextual bandit (MLCB) problem,
  which is a generalization of the linear contextual bandit (LCB) problem. The MLCB
  problem is a decision-making problem in which a learner observes $d$-dimensional
  feature vectors, called arms, chooses an arm from $K$ arms, and then obtains a reward
  from the chosen arm in each round. The learner aims to maximize the sum of the rewards
  over $T$ rounds. In contrast to the LCB problem, the rewards in the MLCB problem
  may not be represented by a linear function in feature vectors; instead, it is approximated
  by a linear function with additive approximation parameter $\\varepsilon \\geq 0$.
  In this paper, we propose an algorithm that achieves $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{dT\\log(K)}
  + \\eps\\sqrt{d}T)$ regret, where $\\tilde{O}(\\cdot)$ ignores polylogarithmic factors
  in $d$ and $T$. This is the first algorithm that guarantees a high-probability regret
  bound for the MLCB problem without knowledge of the approximation parameter $\\varepsilon$. "
