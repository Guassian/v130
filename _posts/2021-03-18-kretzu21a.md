title: " Revisiting Projection-free Online Learning: the Strongly Convex Case "
abstract: " Projection-free optimization algorithms, which are mostly based on the
  classical Frank-Wolfe method, have gained significant interest in the machine learning
  community in recent years due to their ability to handle convex constraints that
  are popular in many applications, but for which computing projections is often computationally
  impractical in high-dimensional settings, and hence prohibit the use of most standard
  projection-based methods. In particular, a significant research effort was put on
  projection-free methods for online learning. In this paper we revisit the Online
  Frank-Wolfe (OFW) method suggested by Hazan and Kale \\cite{Hazan12} and fill a
  gap that has been left unnoticed for several years: OFW achieves a faster rate of
  $O(T^{2/3})$ on strongly convex functions (as opposed to the standard $O(T^{3/4})$
  for convex but not strongly convex functions), where $T$ is the sequence length.
  This is somewhat surprising since it is known that for offline optimization, in
  general, strong convexity does not lead to faster rates for Frank-Wolfe. We also
  revisit the bandit setting under strong convexity and prove a similar bound of $\\tilde
  O(T^{2/3})$ (instead of $O(T^{3/4})$ without strong convexity). Hence, in the current
  state-of-affairs, the best projection-free upper-bounds for the full-information
  and bandit settings with strongly convex and nonsmooth functions match up to logarithmic
  factors in $T$. "
