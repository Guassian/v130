title: " Active Learning under Label Shift "
abstract: ' We address the problem of active learning under label shift: when the
  class proportions of source and target domains differ. We introduce a "medial distribution"
  to incorporate a tradeoff between importance weighting and class-balanced sampling
  and propose their combined usage in active learning. Our method is known as Mediated
  Active Learning under Label Shift (MALLS). It balances the bias from class-balanced
  sampling and the variance from importance weighting. We prove sample complexity
  and generalization guarantees for MALLS which show active learning reduces asymptotic
  sample complexity even under arbitrary label shift. We empirically demonstrate MALLS
  scales to high-dimensional datasets and can reduce the sample complexity of active
  learning by 60% in deep active learning tasks. '
