title: " Fundamental Limits of Ridge-Regularized Empirical Risk Minimization in High
  Dimensions "
abstract: " Despite the popularity of Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) algorithms,
  a theory that explains their statistical properties in modern high-dimensional regimes
  is only recently emerging. We characterize for the first time the fundamental limits
  on the statistical accuracy of convex ridge-regularized ERM for inference in high-dimensional
  generalized linear models. For a stylized setting with Gaussian features and problem
  dimensions that grow large at a proportional rate, we start with sharp performance
  characterizations and then derive tight lower bounds on the estimation and prediction
  error. Our bounds provably hold over a wide class of loss functions, and, for any
  value of the regularization parameter and of the sampling ratio. Our precise analysis
  has several attributes. First, it leads to a recipe for optimally tuning the loss
  function and the regularization parameter. Second, it allows to precisely quantify
  the sub-optimality of popular heuristic choices, such as optimally-tuned least-squares.
  Third, we use the bounds to precisely assess the merits of ridge-regularization
  as a function of the sampling ratio. Our bounds are expressed in terms of the Fisher
  Information of random variables that are simple functions of the data distribution,
  thus making ties to corresponding bounds in classical statistics. "
