title: " Stable ResNet "
abstract: " Deep ResNet architectures have achieved state of the art performance on
  many tasks. While they solve the problem of gradient vanishing, they might suffer
  from gradient exploding as the depth becomes large (Yang et al. 2017). Moreover,
  recent results have shown that ResNet might lose expressivity as the depth goes
  to infinity (Yang et al. 2017, Hayou et al. 2019). To resolve these issues, we introduce
  a new class of ResNet architectures, calledStable ResNet, that have the property
  of stabilizing the gradient while ensuring expressivity in the infinite depth limit. "
