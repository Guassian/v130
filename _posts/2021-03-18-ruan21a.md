title: " Towards Flexible Device Participation in Federated Learning "
abstract: " Traditional federated learning algorithms impose strict requirements on
  the participation rates of devices, which limit the potential reach of federated
  learning. This paper extends the current learning paradigm to include devices that
  may become inactive, compute incomplete updates, and depart or arrive in the middle
  of training. We derive analytical results to illustrate how allowing more flexible
  device participation can affect the learning convergence when data is not independently
  and identically distributed (non-IID). We then propose a new federated aggregation
  scheme that converges even when devices may be inactive or return incomplete updates.
  We also study how the learning process can adapt to early departures or late arrivals,
  and analyze their impacts on the convergence. "
