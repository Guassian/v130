title: " Location Trace Privacy Under Conditional Priors "
abstract: " Providing meaningful privacy to users of location based services is particularly
  challenging when multiple locations are revealed in a short period of time. This
  is primarily due to the tremendous degree of dependence that can be anticipated
  between points. We propose a Rényi divergence based privacy framework for bounding
  expected privacy loss for conditionally dependent data. Additionally, we demonstrate
  an algorithm for achieving this privacy under Gaussian process conditional priors.
  This framework both exemplifies why conditionally dependent data is so challenging
  to protect and offers a strategy for preserving privacy to within a fixed radius
  for sensitive locations in a user’s trace. "
