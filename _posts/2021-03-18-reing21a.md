title: " Influence Decompositions For Neural Network Attribution "
abstract: " Methods of neural network attribution have emerged out of a necessity
  for explanation and accountability in the predictions of black-box neural models.
  Most approaches use a variation of sensitivity analysis, where individual input
  variables are perturbed and the downstream effects on some output metric are measured.
  We demonstrate that a number of critical functional properties are not revealed
  when only considering lower-order perturbations. Motivated by these shortcomings,
  we propose a general framework for decomposing the orders of influence that a collection
  of input variables has on an output classification. These orders are based on the
  cardinality of input subsets which are perturbed to yield a change in classification.
  This decomposition can be naturally applied to attribute which input variables rely
  on higher-order coordination to impact the classification decision. We demonstrate
  that our approach correctly identifies higher-order attribution on a number of synthetic
  examples. Additionally, we showcase the differences between attribution in our approach
  and existing approaches on benchmark networks for MNIST and ImageNet. "
