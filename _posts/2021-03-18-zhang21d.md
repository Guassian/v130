title: " On the Suboptimality of Negative Momentum for Minimax Optimization "
abstract: " Smooth game optimization has recently attracted great interest in machine
  learning as it generalizes the single-objective optimization paradigm. However,
  game dynamics is more complex due to the interaction between different players and
  is therefore fundamentally different from minimization, posing new challenges for
  algorithm design. Notably, it has been shown that negative momentum is preferred
  due to its ability to reduce oscillation in game dynamics. Nevertheless, existing
  analysis of negative momentum was restricted to simple bilinear games. In this paper,
  we extend the analysis to smooth and strongly-convex strongly-concave minimax games
  by taking the variational inequality formulation. By connecting Polyakâ€™s momentum
  with Chebyshev polynomials, we show that negative momentum accelerates convergence
  of game dynamics locally, though with a suboptimal rate. To the best of our knowledge,
  this is the \\emph{first work} that provides an explicit convergence rate for negative
  momentum in this setting. "
