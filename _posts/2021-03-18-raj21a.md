title: " Explicit Regularization of Stochastic Gradient Methods through Duality "
abstract: " We consider stochastic gradient methods under the interpolation regime
  where a perfect fit can be obtained (minimum loss at each observation). While previous
  work highlighted the implicit regularization of such algorithms, we consider an
  explicit regularization framework as a minimum Bregman divergence convex feasibility
  problem. Using convex duality, we propose randomized Dykstra-style algorithms based
  on randomized dual coordinate ascent. For non-accelerated coordinate descent, we
  obtain an algorithm which bears strong similarities with (non-averaged) stochastic
  mirror descent on specific functions, as it is equivalent for quadratic objectives,
  and equivalent in the early iterations for more general objectives. It comes with
  the benefit of an explicit convergence theorem to a minimum norm solution. For accelerated
  coordinate descent, we obtain a new algorithm that has better convergence properties
  than existing stochastic gradient methods in the interpolating regime. This leads
  to accelerated versions of the perceptron for generic $\\ell_p$-norm regularizers,
  which we illustrate in experiments. "
