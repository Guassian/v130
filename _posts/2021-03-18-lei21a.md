title: " Last iterate convergence in no-regret learning: constrained min-max optimization
  for convex-concave landscapes "
abstract: ' In a recent series of papers it has been established that variants of
  Gradient Descent/Ascent and Mirror Descent exhibit last iterate convergence in convex-concave
  zero-sum games. Specifically, Daskalakis et al 2018, Liang-Stokes 2019, show last
  iterate convergence of the so called â€œOptimistic Gradient Descent/Ascent" for the
  case of \textit{unconstrained} min-max optimization. Moreover, in Mertikopoulos
  et al 2019 the authors show that Mirror Descent with an extra gradient step displays
  last iterate convergence for convex-concave problems (both constrained and unconstrained),
  though their algorithm uses \textit{vanishing stepsizes}. In this work, we show
  that "Optimistic Multiplicative-Weights Update (OMWU)" with \textit{constant stepsize},
  exhibits last iterate convergence locally for convex-concave games, generalizing
  the results of Daskalakis and Panageas 2019 where last iterate convergence of OMWU
  was shown only for the \textit{bilinear case}. To the best of our knowledge, this
  is the first result about last-iterate convergence for constrained zero sum games
  (beyond the bilinear case) in which the dynamics use constant step-sizes. '
