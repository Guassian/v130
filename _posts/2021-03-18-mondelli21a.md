title: " Approximate Message Passing with Spectral Initialization for Generalized
  Linear Models "
abstract: " We consider the problem of estimating a signal from measurements obtained
  via a generalized linear model. We focus on estimators based on approximate message
  passing (AMP), a family of iterative algorithms with many appealing features: the
  performance of AMP in the high-dimensional limit can be succinctly characterized
  under suitable model assumptions; AMP can also be tailored to the empirical distribution
  of the signal entries, and for a wide class of estimation problems, AMP is conjectured
  to be optimal among all polynomial-time algorithms. However, a major issue of AMP
  is that in many models (such as phase retrieval), it requires an initialization
  correlated with the ground-truth signal and independent from the measurement matrix.
  Assuming that such an initialization is available is typically not realistic. In
  this paper, we solve this problem by proposing an AMP algorithm initialized with
  a spectral estimator. With such an initialization, the standard AMP analysis fails
  since the spectral estimator depends in a complicated way on the design matrix.
  Our main contribution is a rigorous characterization of the performance of AMP with
  spectral initialization in the high-dimensional limit. The key technical idea is
  to define and analyze a two-phase artificial AMP algorithm that first produces the
  spectral estimator, and then closely approximates the iterates of the true AMP.
  We also provide numerical results that demonstrate the validity of the proposed
  approach. "
