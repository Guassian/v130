title: " Wyner-Ziv Estimators: Efficient Distributed Mean Estimation with Side-Information "
abstract: " Communication efficient distributed mean estimation is an important primitive
  that arises in many distributed learning and optimization scenarios such as federated
  learning. Without any probabilistic assumptions on the underlying data, we study
  the problem of distributed mean estimation where the server has access to side information.
  We propose \\emph{Wyner-Ziv estimators}, which are efficient and near-optimal when
  an upper bound for the distance between the side information and the data is known.
  In a different direction, when there is no knowledge assumed about the distance
  between side information and the data, we present an alternative Wyner-Ziv estimator
  that uses correlated sampling. This latter setting offers universal recovery guarantees,
  and perhaps will be of interest in practice when the number of users is large, where
  keeping track of the distances between the data and the side information may not
  be possible. "
