title: " Aggregating Incomplete and Noisy Rankings "
abstract: " We consider the problem of learning the true ordering of a set of alternatives
  from largely incomplete and noisy rankings. We introduce a natural generalization
  of both the Mallows model, a popular model of ranking distributions, and the extensively
  studied model of ranking from pairwise comparisons. Our selective Mallows model
  outputs a noisy ranking on any given subset of alternatives, based on an underlying
  Mallows distribution. Assuming a sequence of subsets where each pair of alternatives
  appears frequently enough, we obtain strong asymptotically tight upper and lower
  bounds on the sample complexity of learning the underlying complete central ranking
  and the (identities and the) ranking of the top k alternatives from selective Mallows
  rankings. Moreover, building on the work of (Braverman and Mossel, 2009), we show
  how to efficiently compute the maximum likelihood complete ranking from selective
  Mallows rankings. "
