title: " Active Online Learning with Hidden Shifting Domains "
abstract: " Online machine learning systems need to adapt to domain shifts. Meanwhile,
  acquiring label at every timestep is expensive. We propose a surprisingly simple
  algorithm that adaptively balances its regret and its number of label queries in
  settings where the data streams are from a mixture of hidden domains. For online
  linear regression with oblivious adversaries, we provide a tight tradeoff that depends
  on the durations and dimensionalities of the hidden domains. Our algorithm can adaptively
  deal with interleaving spans of inputs from different domains. We also generalize
  our results to non-linear regression for hypothesis classes with bounded eluder
  dimension and adaptive adversaries. Experiments on synthetic and realistic datasets
  demonstrate that our algorithm achieves lower regret than uniform queries and greedy
  queries with equal labeling budget. "
