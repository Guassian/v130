title: " CLAR: Contrastive Learning of Auditory Representations "
abstract: " Learning rich visual representations using contrastive self-supervised
  learning has been extremely successful. However, it is still a major question whether
  we could use a similar approach to learn superior auditory representations. In this
  paper, we expand on prior work (SimCLR) to learn better auditory representations.
  We (1) introduce various data augmentations suitable for auditory data and evaluate
  their impact on predictive performance, (2) show that training with time-frequency
  audio features substantially improves the quality of the learned representations
  compared to raw signals, and (3) demonstrate that training with both supervised
  and contrastive losses simultaneously improves the learned representations compared
  to self-supervised pre-training followed by supervised fine-tuning. We illustrate
  that by combining all these methods and with substantially less labeled data, our
  framework (CLAR) achieves significant improvement on prediction performance compared
  to supervised approach. Moreover, compared to self-supervised approach, our framework
  converges faster with significantly better representations. "
