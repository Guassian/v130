title: " Minimax Optimal Regression over Sobolev Spaces via Laplacian Regularization
  on Neighborhood Graphs "
abstract: " In this paper we study the statistical properties of Laplacian smoothing,
  a graph-based approach to nonparametric regression. Under standard regularity conditions,
  we establish upper bounds on the error of the Laplacian smoothing estimator \\smash{$\\widehat{f}$},
  and a goodness-of-fit test also based on \\smash{$\\widehat{f}$}. These upper bounds
  match the minimax optimal estimation and testing rates of convergence over the first-order
  Sobolev class $H^1(\\mathcal{X})$, for $\\mathcal{X} \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^d$ and
  $1 \\leq d < 4$; in the estimation problem, for $d = 4$, they are optimal modulo
  a $\\log n$ factor. Additionally, we prove that Laplacian smoothing is manifold-adaptive:
  if $\\mathcal{X} \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^d$ is an $m$-dimensional manifold with $m
  < d$, then the error rate of Laplacian smoothing (in either estimation or testing)
  depends only on $m$, in the same way it would if $\\mathcal{X}$ were a full-dimensional
  set in $\\mathbb{R}^m$. "
