title: " An Optimal Reduction of TV-Denoising to Adaptive Online Learning "
abstract: " We consider the problem of estimating a function from $n$ noisy samples
  whose discrete Total Variation (TV) is bounded by $C_n$. We reveal a deep connection
  to the seemingly disparate problem of \\emph{Strongly Adaptive} online learning
  [Daniely et al 2015] and provide an $O(n \\log n)$ time algorithm that attains the
  near minimax optimal rate of $\\tilde O (n^{1/3}C_n^{2/3})$ under squared error
  loss. The resulting algorithm runs online and optimally \\emph{adapts} to the \\emph{unknown}
  smoothness parameter $C_n$. This leads to a new and more versatile alternative to
  wavelets-based methods for (1) adaptively estimating TV bounded functions; (2) online
  forecasting of TV bounded trends in time series. "
