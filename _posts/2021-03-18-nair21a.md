title: " Budgeted and Non-Budgeted Causal Bandits "
abstract: " Learning good interventions in a causal graph can be modelled as a stochastic
  multi-armed bandit problem with side-information. First, we study this problem when
  interventions are more expensive than observations and a budget is specified. If
  there are no backdoor paths from the intervenable nodes to the reward node then
  we propose an algorithm to minimize simple regret that optimally trades-off observations
  and interventions based on the cost of intervention. We also propose an algorithm
  that accounts for the cost of interventions, utilizes causal side-information, and
  minimizes the expected cumulative regret without exceeding the budget. Our algorithm
  performs better than standard algorithms that do not take side-information into
  account. Finally, we study the problem of learning best interventions without budget
  constraint in general graphs and give an algorithm that achieves constant expected
  cumulative regret in terms of the instance parameters when the parent distribution
  of the reward variable for each intervention is known. Our results are experimentally
  validated and compared to the best-known bounds in the current literature. "
