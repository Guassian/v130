title: " Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers for Quantization "
abstract: ' Quantization of the parameters of machine learning models, such as deep
  neural networks, requires solving constrained optimization problems, where the constraint
  set is formed by the Cartesian product of many simple discrete sets. For such optimization
  problems, we study the performance of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers
  for Quantization (ADMM-Q) algorithm, which is a variant of the widely-used ADMM
  method applied to our discrete optimization problem. We establish the convergence
  of the iterates of ADMM-Q to certain stationary points. To the best of our knowledge,
  this is the first analysis of an ADMM-type method for problems with discrete variables/constraints.
  Based on our theoretical insights, we develop a few variants of ADMM-Q that can
  handle inexact update rules, and have improved performance via the use of "soft
  projection" and "injecting randomness to the algorithm". We empirically evaluate
  the efficacy of our proposed approaches. '
