title: " Competing AI: How does competition feedback affect machine learning? "
abstract: " This papers studies how competition affects machine learning (ML) predictors.
  As ML becomes more ubiquitous, it is often deployed by companies to compete over
  customers. For example, digital platforms like Yelp use ML to predict user preference
  and make recommendations. A service that is more often queried by users, perhaps
  because it more accurately anticipates user preferences, is also more likely to
  obtain additional user data (e.g. in the form of a Yelp review). Thus, competing
  predictors cause feedback loops whereby a predictorâ€™s performance impacts what training
  data it receives and biases its predictions over time. We introduce a flexible model
  of competing ML predictors that enables both rapid experimentation and theoretical
  tractability. We show with empirical and mathematical analysis that competition
  causes predictors to specialize for specific sub-populations at the cost of worse
  performance over the general population. We further analyze the impact of predictor
  specialization on the overall prediction quality experienced by users. We show that
  having too few or too many competing predictors in a market can hurt the overall
  prediction quality. Our theory is complemented by experiments on several real datasets
  using popular learning algorithms, such as neural networks and nearest neighbor
  methods. "
