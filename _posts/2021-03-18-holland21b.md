title: " Learning with risk-averse feedback under potentially heavy tails "
abstract: " We study learning algorithms that seek to minimize the conditional value-at-risk
  (CVaR), when all the learner knows is that the losses (and gradients) incurred may
  be heavy-tailed. We begin by studying a general-purpose estimator of CVaR for potentially
  heavy-tailed random variables, which is easy to implement in practice, and requires
  nothing more than finite variance and a distribution function that does not change
  too fast or slow around just the quantile of interest. With this estimator in hand,
  we then derive a new learning algorithm which robustly chooses among candidates
  produced by stochastic gradient-driven sub-processes, obtain excess CVaR bounds,
  and finally complement the theory with a regression application. "
