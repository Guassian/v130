title: " Nonlinear Projection Based Gradient Estimation for Query Efficient Blackbox
  Attacks "
abstract: " Gradient estimation and vector space projection have been studied as two
  distinct topics. We aim to bridge the gap between the two by investigating how to
  efficiently estimate gradient based on a projected low-dimensional space. We first
  provide lower and upper bounds for gradient estimation under both linear and nonlinear
  projections, and outline checkable sufficient conditions under which one is better
  than the other. Moreover, we analyze the query complexity for the projection-based
  gradient estimation and present a sufficient condition for query-efficient estimators.
  Built upon our theoretic analysis, we propose a novel query-efficient Nonlinear
  Gradient Projection-based Boundary Blackbox Attack (NonLinear-BA). We conduct extensive
  experiments on four image datasets: ImageNet, CelebA, CIFAR-10, and MNIST, and show
  the superiority of the proposed methods compared with the state-of-the-art baselines.
  In particular, we show that the projection-based boundary blackbox attacks are able
  to achieve much smaller magnitude of perturbations with 100% attack success rate
  based on efficient queries. Both linear and nonlinear projections demonstrate their
  advantages under different conditions. We also evaluate NonLinear-BA against the
  commercial online API MEGVII Face++, and demonstrate the high blackbox attack performance
  both quantitatively and qualitatively. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/AI-secure/NonLinear-BA. "
