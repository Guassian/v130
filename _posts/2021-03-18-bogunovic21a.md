title: " Stochastic Linear Bandits Robust to Adversarial Attacks "
abstract: " We consider a stochastic linear bandit problem in which the rewards are
  not only subject to random noise, but also adversarial attacks subject to a suitable
  budget $C$ (i.e., an upper bound on the sum of corruption magnitudes across the
  time horizon). We provide two variants of a Robust Phased Elimination algorithm,
  one that knows $C$ and one that does not. Both variants are shown to attain near-optimal
  regret in the non-corrupted case $C = 0$, while incurring additional additive terms
  respectively having a linear and quadratic dependency on $C$ in general. We present
  algorithm-independent lower bounds showing that these additive terms are near-optimal.
  In addition, in a contextual setting, we revisit a setup of diverse contexts, and
  show that a simple greedy algorithm is provably robust with a near-optimal additive
  regret term, despite performing no explicit exploration and not knowing $C$. "
