title: " Tight Differential Privacy for Discrete-Valued Mechanisms and for the Subsampled
  Gaussian Mechanism Using FFT "
abstract: " We propose a numerical accountant for evaluating the tight (ε,δ)-privacy
  loss for algorithms with discrete one dimensional output. The method is based on
  the privacy loss distribution formalism and it uses the recently introduced fast
  Fourier transform based accounting technique. We carry out an error analysis of
  the method in terms of moment bounds of the privacy loss distribution which leads
  to rigorous lower and upper bounds for the true (ε,δ)-values. As an application,
  we present a novel approach to accurate privacy accounting of the subsampled Gaussian
  mechanism. This completes the previously proposed analysis by giving strict lower
  and upper bounds for the privacy parameters. We demonstrate the performance of the
  accountant on the binomial mechanism and show that our approach allows decreasing
  noise variance up to 75 percent at equal privacy compared to existing bounds in
  the literature. We also illustrate how to compute tight bounds for the exponential
  mechanism applied to counting queries. "
