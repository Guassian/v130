title: " Accelerating Metropolis-Hastings with Lightweight Inference Compilation "
abstract: " In order to construct accurate proposers for Metropolis-Hastings Markov
  Chain Monte Carlo, we integrate ideas from probabilistic graphical models and neural
  networks in an open-source framework we call Lightweight Inference Compilation (LIC).
  LIC implements amortized inference within an open-universe declarative probabilistic
  programming language (PPL). Graph neural networks are used to parameterize proposal
  distributions as functions of Markov blankets, which during “compilation” are optimized
  to approximate single-site Gibbs sampling distributions. Unlike prior work in inference
  compilation (IC), LIC forgoes importance sampling of linear execution traces in
  favor of operating directly on Bayesian networks. Through using a declarative PPL,
  the Markov blankets of nodes (which may be non-static) are queried at inference-time
  to produce proposers Experimental results show LIC can produce proposers which have
  less parameters, greater robustness to nuisance random variables, and improved posterior
  sampling in a Bayesian logistic regression and n-schools inference application. "
