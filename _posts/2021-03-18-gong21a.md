title: " Variational Selective Autoencoder: Learning from Partially-Observed Heterogeneous
  Data "
abstract: " Learning from heterogeneous data poses challenges such as combining data
  from various sources and of different types. Meanwhile, heterogeneous data are often
  associated with missingness in real-world applications due to heterogeneity and
  noise of input sources. In this work, we propose the variational selective autoencoder
  (VSAE), a general framework to learn representations from partially-observed heterogeneous
  data. VSAE learns the latent dependencies in heterogeneous data by modeling the
  joint distribution of observed data, unobserved data, and the imputation mask which
  represents how the data are missing. It results in a unified model for various downstream
  tasks including data generation and imputation. Evaluation on both low-dimensional
  and high-dimensional heterogeneous datasets for these two tasks shows improvement
  over state-of-the-art models. "
