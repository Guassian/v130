title: " CONTRA: Contrarian statistics for controlled variable selection "
abstract: " The holdout randomization test (HRT) discovers a set of covariates most
  predictive of a response. Given the covariate distribution, HRTs can explicitly
  control the false discovery rate (FDR). However, if this distribution is unknown
  and must be estimated from data, HRTs can inflate the FDR. To alleviate the inflation
  of FDR, we propose the contrarian randomization test (CONTRA), which is designed
  explicitly for scenarios where the covariate distribution must be estimated from
  data and may even be misspecified. Our key insight is to use an equal mixture of
  two “contrarian” probabilistic models in determining the importance of a covariate.
  One model is fit with the real data, while the other is fit using the same data,
  but with the covariate being tested replaced with samples from an estimate of the
  covariate distribution. CONTRA is flexible enough to achieve a power of 1 asymptotically,
  can reduce the FDR compared to state-of-the-art CVS methods when the covariate distribution
  is misspecified, and is computationally efficient in high dimensions and large sample
  sizes. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of CONTRA on numerous synthetic
  benchmarks, and highlight its capabilities on a genetic dataset. "
