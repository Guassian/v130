title: " Spectral Tensor Train Parameterization of Deep Learning Layers "
abstract: " We study low-rank parameterizations of weight matrices with embedded spectral
  properties in the Deep Learning context. The low-rank property leads to parameter
  efficiency and permits taking computational shortcuts when computing mappings. Spectral
  properties are often subject to constraints in optimization problems, leading to
  better models and stability of optimization. We start by looking at the compact
  SVD parameterization of weight matrices and identifying redundancy sources in the
  parameterization. We further apply the Tensor Train (TT) decomposition to the compact
  SVD components, and propose a non-redundant differentiable parameterization of fixed
  TT-rank tensor manifolds, termed the Spectral Tensor Train Parameterization (STTP).
  We demonstrate the effects of neural network compression in the image classification
  setting, and both compression and improved training stability in the generative
  adversarial training setting. Project website: www.obukhov.ai/sttp "
