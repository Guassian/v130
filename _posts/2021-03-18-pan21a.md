title: " Fourier Bases for Solving Permutation Puzzles "
abstract: " Traditionally, permutation puzzles such as the Rubik’s Cube were often
  solved by heuristic search like $A^*\\!$-search and value based reinforcement learning
  methods. Both heuristic search and Q-learning approaches to solving these puzzles
  can be reduced to learning a heuristic/value function to decide what puzzle move
  to make at each step. We propose learning a value function using the irreducible
  representations basis (which we will also call the Fourier basis) of the puzzle’s
  underlying group. Classical Fourier analysis on real valued functions tells us we
  can approximate smooth functions with low frequency basis functions. Similarly,
  smooth functions on finite groups can be represented by the analogous low frequency
  Fourier basis functions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of learning a value function
  in the Fourier basis for solving various permutation puzzles and show that it outperforms
  standard deep learning methods. "
