title: " PClean: Bayesian Data Cleaning at Scale with Domain-Specific Probabilistic
  Programming "
abstract: " Data cleaning is naturally framed as probabilistic inference in a generative
  model of ground-truth data and likely errors, but the diversity of real-world error
  patterns and the hardness of inference make Bayesian approaches difficult to automate.
  We present PClean, a probabilistic programming language (PPL) for leveraging dataset-specific
  knowledge to automate Bayesian cleaning. Compared to general-purpose PPLs, PClean
  tackles a restricted problem domain, enabling three modeling and inference innovations:
  (1) a non-parametric model of relational database instances, which users’ programs
  customize; (2) a novel sequential Monte Carlo inference algorithm that exploits
  the structure of PClean’s model class; and (3) a compiler that generates near-optimal
  SMC proposals and blocked-Gibbs rejuvenation kernels based on the user’s model and
  data. We show empirically that short (< 50-line) PClean programs can: be faster
  and more accurate than generic PPL inference on data-cleaning benchmarks; match
  state-of-the-art data-cleaning systems in terms of accuracy and runtime (unlike
  generic PPL inference in the same runtime); and scale to real-world datasets with
  millions of records. "
