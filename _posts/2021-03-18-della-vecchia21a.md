title: " Regularized ERM on random subspaces "
abstract: " We study a natural extension of classical empirical risk minimization,
  where the hypothesis space is a random subspace of a given space. In particular,
  we consider possibly data dependent subspaces spanned by a random subset of the
  data, recovering as a special case Nystr√∂m approaches for kernel methods. Considering
  random subspaces naturally leads to computational savings, but the question is whether
  the corresponding learning accuracy is degraded. These statistical-computational
  tradeoffs have been recently explored for the least squares loss and self-concordant
  loss functions, such as the logistic loss. Here, we work to ex- tend these results
  to convex Lipschitz loss functions, that might not be smooth, such as the hinge
  loss used in support vector ma- chines. This extension requires developing new proofs,
  that use different technical tools. Our main results show the existence of different
  settings, depending on how hard the learning problem is, for which computational
  efficiency can be improved with no loss in performance. Theoretical results are
  illustrated with simple numerical experiments. "
