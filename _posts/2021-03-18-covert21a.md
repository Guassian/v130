title: " Improving KernelSHAP: Practical Shapley Value Estimation Using Linear Regression "
abstract: " The Shapley value concept from cooperative game theory has become a popular
  technique for interpreting ML models, but efficiently estimating these values remains
  challenging, particularly in the model-agnostic setting. Here, we revisit the idea
  of estimating Shapley values via linear regression to understand and improve upon
  this approach. By analyzing the original KernelSHAP alongside a newly proposed unbiased
  version, we develop techniques to detect its convergence and calculate uncertainty
  estimates. We also find that the original version incurs a negligible increase in
  bias in exchange for significantly lower variance, and we propose a variance reduction
  technique that further accelerates the convergence of both estimators. Finally,
  we develop a version of KernelSHAP for stochastic cooperative games that yields
  fast new estimators for two global explanation methods. "
