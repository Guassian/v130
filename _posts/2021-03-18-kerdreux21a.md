title: " Projection-Free Optimization on Uniformly Convex Sets "
abstract: " The Frank-Wolfe method solves smooth constrained convex optimization problems
  at a generic sublinear rate of $\\mathcal{O}(1/T)$, and it (or its variants) enjoys
  accelerated convergence rates for two fundamental classes of constraints: polytopes
  and strongly-convex sets. Uniformly convex sets non-trivially subsume strongly convex
  sets and form a large variety of \\textit{curved} convex sets commonly encountered
  in machine learning and signal processing. For instance, the $\\ell_p$-balls are
  uniformly convex for all $p > 1$, but strongly convex for $p\\in]1,2]$ only. We
  show that these sets systematically induce accelerated convergence rates for the
  original Frank-Wolfe algorithm, which continuously interpolate between known rates.
  Our accelerated convergence rates emphasize that it is the curvature of the constraint
  sets – not just their strong convexity – that leads to accelerated convergence rates.
  These results also importantly highlight that the Frank-Wolfe algorithm is adaptive
  to much more generic constraint set structures, thus explaining faster empirical
  convergence. Finally, we also show accelerated convergence rates when the set is
  only locally uniformly convex around the optima and provide similar results in online
  linear optimization. "
