title: " Revisiting the Role of Euler Numerical Integration on Acceleration and Stability
  in Convex Optimization "
abstract: " Viewing optimization methods as numerical integrators for ordinary differential
  equations (ODEs) provides a thought-provoking modern framework for studying accelerated
  first-order optimizers. In this literature, acceleration is often supposed to be
  linked to the quality of the integrator (accuracy, energy preservation, symplecticity).
  In this work, we propose a novel ordinary differential equation that questions this
  connection: both the explicit and the semi-implicit (a.k.a symplectic) Euler discretizations
  on this ODE lead to an accelerated algorithm for convex programming. Although semi-implicit
  methods are well-known in numerical analysis to enjoy many desirable features for
  the integration of physical systems, our findings show that these properties do
  not necessarily relate to acceleration. "
