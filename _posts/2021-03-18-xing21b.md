title: " On the Generalization Properties of Adversarial Training "
abstract: " Modern machine learning and deep learning models are shown to be vulnerable
  when testing data are slightly perturbed. Theoretical studies of adversarial training
  algorithms mostly focus on their adversarial training losses or local convergence
  properties. In contrast, this paper studies the generalization performance of a
  generic adversarial training algorithm. Specifically, we consider linear regression
  models and two-layer neural networks (with lazy training) using squared loss under
  low-dimensional regime and high-dimensional regime. In the former regime, after
  overcoming the non-smoothness of adversarial training, the adversarial risk of the
  trained models will converge to the minimal adversarial risk. In the latter regime,
  we discover that data interpolation prevents the adversarial robust estimator from
  being consistent (i.e. converge in probability). Therefore, inspired by successes
  of the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), we incorporate the
  $\\mathcal{L}_1$ penalty in the high dimensional adversarial learning, and show
  that it leads to consistent adversarial robust estimation. A series of numerical
  studies are conducted to demonstrate that how the smoothness and $\\mathcal{L}_1$
  penalization help to improve the adversarial robustness of DNN models. "
