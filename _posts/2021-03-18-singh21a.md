title: " Continuum-Armed Bandits: A Function Space Perspective "
abstract: " The continuum-armed bandits problem involves optimizing an unknown objective
  function given an oracle that evaluates the function at a query point. In the most
  well-studied case, the objective function is assumed to be Lipschitz continuous
  and minimax rates of simple and cumulative regrets are known under both noiseless
  and noisy conditions. In this paper, we investigate continuum-armed bandits under
  more general smoothness conditions, namely Besov smoothness conditions, on the objective
  function. In both noiseless and noisy conditions, we derive minimax rates under
  both simple and cumulative regrets. In particular, our results show that minimax
  rates over objective functions in a Besov space are identical to minimax rates over
  objective functions in the smallest Holder space into which the Besov space embeds. "
