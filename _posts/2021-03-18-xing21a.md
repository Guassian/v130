title: " Predictive Power of Nearest Neighbors Algorithm under Random Perturbation "
abstract: " This work investigates the predictive performance of the classical $k$
  Nearest Neighbors ($k$-NN) algorithm when the testing data are corrupted by random
  perturbation. The impact of corruption level on the asymptotic regret is carefully
  characterized and we reveal a phase-transition phenomenon that, when the corruption
  level of the random perturbation $\\omega$ is below a critical order (i.e., small-$\\omega$
  regime), the asymptotic regret remains the same; when it is beyond that order (i.e.,
  large-$\\omega$ regime), the asymptotic regret deteriorates polynomially. More importantly,
  the regret of $k$-NN classifier heuristically matches the rate of minimax regret
  for randomly perturbed testing data, thus implies the strong robustness of $k$-NN
  against random perturbation on testing data. In fact, we show that the classical
  $k$-NN can achieve no worse predictive performance, compared to the NN classifiers
  trained via the popular noise-injection strategy. Our numerical experiment also
  illustrates that combining $k$-NN component with modern learning algorithms will
  inherit the strong robustness of $k$-NN. As a technical by-product, we prove that
  under different model assumptions, the pre-processed 1-NN proposed in \\cite{xue2017achieving}
  will at most achieve a sub-optimal rate when the data dimension $d>4$ even if $k$
  is chosen optimally in the pre-processing step. "
