title: " A Limited-Capacity Minimax Theorem for Non-Convex Games or: How I Learned
  to Stop Worrying about Mixed-Nash and Love Neural Nets "
abstract: " Adversarial training, a special case of multi-objective optimization,
  is an increasingly prevalent machine learning technique: some of its most notable
  applications include GAN-based generative modeling and self-play techniques in reinforcement
  learning which have been applied to complex games such as Go or Poker. In practice,
  a \\emph{single} pair of networks is typically trained in order to find an approximate
  equilibrium of a highly nonconcave-nonconvex adversarial problem. However, while
  a classic result in game theory states such an equilibrium exists in concave-convex
  games, there is no analogous guarantee if the payoff is nonconcave-nonconvex. Our
  main contribution is to provide an approximate minimax theorem for a large class
  of games where the players pick neural networks including WGAN, StarCraft II and
  Blotto Game. Our findings rely on the fact that despite being nonconcave-nonconvex
  with respect to the neural networks parameters, these games are concave-convex with
  respect to the actual models (e.g., functions or distributions) represented by these
  neural networks. "
