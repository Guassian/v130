title: " Latent Derivative Bayesian Last Layer Networks "
abstract: " Bayesian neural networks (BNN) are powerful parametric models for nonlinear
  regression with uncertainty quantification. However, the approximate inference techniques
  for weight space priors suffer from several drawbacks. The ‘Bayesian last layer’
  (BLL) is an alternative BNN approach that learns the feature space for an exact
  Bayesian linear model with explicit predictive distributions. However, its predictions
  outside of the data distribution (OOD) are typically overconfident, as the marginal
  likelihood objective results in a learned feature space that overfits to the data.
  We overcome this weakness by introducing a functional prior on the model’s derivatives
  w.r.t. the inputs. Treating these Jacobians as latent variables, we incorporate
  the prior into the objective to influence the smoothness and diversity of the features,
  which enables greater predictive uncertainty. For the BLL, the Jacobians can be
  computed directly using forward mode automatic differentiation, and the distribution
  over Jacobians may be obtained in closed-form. We demonstrate this method enhances
  the BLL to Gaussian process-like performance on tasks where calibrated uncertainty
  is critical: OOD regression, Bayesian optimization and active learning, which include
  high-dimensional real-world datasets. "
