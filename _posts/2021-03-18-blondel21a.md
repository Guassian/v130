title: " Differentiable Divergences Between Time Series "
abstract: " Computing the discrepancy between time series of variable sizes is notoriously
  challenging. While dynamic time warping (DTW) is popularly used for this purpose,
  it is not differentiable everywhere and is known to lead to bad local optima when
  used as a “loss”. Soft-DTW addresses these issues, but it is not a positive definite
  divergence: due to the bias introduced by entropic regularization, it can be negative
  and it is not minimized when the time series are equal. We propose in this paper
  a new divergence, dubbed soft-DTW divergence, which aims to correct these issues.
  We study its properties; in particular, under conditions on the ground cost, we
  show that it is a valid divergence: it is non-negative and minimized if and only
  if the two time series are equal. We also propose a new “sharp” variant by further
  removing entropic bias. We showcase our divergences on time series averaging and
  demonstrate significant accuracy improvements compared to both DTW and soft-DTW
  on 84 time series classification datasets. "
