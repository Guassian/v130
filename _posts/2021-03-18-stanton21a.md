title: " Kernel Interpolation for Scalable Online Gaussian Processes "
abstract: " Gaussian processes (GPs) provide a gold standard for performance in online
  settings, such as sample-efficient control and black box optimization, where we
  need to update a posterior distribution as we acquire data in a sequential online
  setting. However, updating a GP posterior to accommodate even a single new observation
  after having observed $n$ points incurs at least $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ computations
  in the exact setting. We show how to use structured kernel interpolation to efficiently
  reuse computations for constant-time $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ online updates with respect
  to the number of points $n$, while retaining exact inference. We demonstrate the
  promise of our approach in a range of online regression and classification settings,
  Bayesian optimization, and active sampling to reduce error in malaria incidence
  forecasting. "
