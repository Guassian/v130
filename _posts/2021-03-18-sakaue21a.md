title: " Differentiable Greedy Algorithm for Monotone Submodular Maximization: Guarantees,
  Gradient Estimators, and Applications "
abstract: " Motivated by, e.g., sensitivity analysis and end-to-end learning, the
  demand for differentiable optimization algorithms has been increasing. This paper
  presents a theoretically guaranteed differentiable greedy algorithm for monotone
  submodular function maximization. We smooth the greedy algorithm via randomization,
  and prove that it almost recovers original approximation guarantees in expectation
  for the cases of cardinality and $\\kappa$-extendible system constraints. We then
  present how to efficiently compute gradient estimators of any expected output-dependent
  quantities. We demonstrate the usefulness of our method by instantiating it for
  various applications. "
