title: " Statistical Guarantees for Transformation Based Models with applications
  to Implicit Variational Inference "
abstract: " Transformation based methods have been an attractive approach in non-parametric
  inference for problems such as unconditioned and conditional density estimation
  due to their unique hierarchical structure that models the data as flexible transformation
  of a set of common latent variables. More recently, transformation based models
  have been used in variational inference (VI) to construct flexible implicit families
  of variational distributions. However, their use in both non-parametric inference
  and variational inference lacks theoretical justification. In the context of non-linear
  latent variable models (NL-LVM), we provide theoretical justification for the use
  of these models in non-parametric inference by showing that the support of the transformation
  induced prior in the space of densities is sufficiently large in the $L_1$ sense
  and show that for this class of priors the posterior concentrates at the optimal
  rate up to a logarithmic factor. Adopting the flexibility demonstrated in the non-parametric
  setting we use the NL-LVM to construct an implicit family of variational distributions,
  deemed as GP-IVI. We delineate sufficient conditions under which GP-IVI achieves
  optimal risk bounds and approximates the true posterior in the sense of the Kullback-Leibler
  divergence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on providing theoretical
  guarantees for implicit variational inference. "
