title: " Learning Prediction Intervals for Regression: Generalization and Calibration "
abstract: " We study the generation of prediction intervals in regression for uncertainty
  quantification. This task can be formalized as an empirical constrained optimization
  problem that minimizes the average interval width while maintaining the coverage
  accuracy across data. We strengthen the existing literature by studying two aspects
  of this empirical optimization. First is a general learning theory to characterize
  the optimality-feasibility tradeoff that encompasses Lipschitz continuity and VC-subgraph
  classes, which are exemplified in regression trees and neural networks. Second is
  a calibration machinery and the corresponding statistical theory to optimally select
  the regularization parameter that manages this tradeoff, which bypasses the overfitting
  issues in previous approaches in coverage attainment. We empirically demonstrate
  the strengths of our interval generation and calibration algorithms in terms of
  testing performances compared to existing benchmarks. "
