title: " Improving predictions of Bayesian neural nets via local linearization "
abstract: ' The generalized Gauss-Newton (GGN) approximation is often used to make
  practical Bayesian deep learning approaches scalable by replacing a second order
  derivative with a product of first order derivatives. In this paper we argue that
  the GGN approximation should be understood as a local linearization of the underlying
  Bayesian neural network (BNN), which turns the BNN into a generalized linear model
  (GLM). Because we use this linearized model for posterior inference, we should also
  predict using this modified model instead of the original one. We refer to this
  modified predictive as "GLM predictive" and show that it effectively resolves common
  underfitting problems of the Laplace approximation. It extends previous results
  in this vein to general likelihoods and has an equivalent Gaussian process formulation,
  which enables alternative inference schemes for BNNs in function space. We demonstrate
  the effectiveness of our approach on several standard classification datasets as
  well as on out-of-distribution detection. We provide an implementation at https://github.com/AlexImmer/BNN-predictions. '
