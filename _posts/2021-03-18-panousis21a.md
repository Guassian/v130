title: " Local Competition and Stochasticity for Adversarial Robustness in Deep Learning "
abstract: " This work addresses adversarial robustness in deep learning by considering
  deep networks with stochastic local winner-takes-all (LWTA) activations. This type
  of network units result in sparse representations from each model layer, as the
  units are organized in blocks where only one unit generates a non-zero output. The
  main operating principle of the introduced units lies on stochastic arguments, as
  the network performs posterior sampling over competing units to select the winner.
  We combine these LWTA arguments with tools from the field of Bayesian non-parametrics,
  specifically the stick-breaking construction of the Indian Buffet Process, to allow
  for inferring the sub-part of each layer that is essential for modeling the data
  at hand. Then, inference is performed by means of stochastic variational Bayes.
  We perform a thorough experimental evaluation of our model using benchmark datasets.
  As we show, our method achieves high robustness to adversarial perturbations, with
  state-of-the-art performance in powerful adversarial attack schemes. "
