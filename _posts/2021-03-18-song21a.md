title: " Evading the Curse of Dimensionality in Unconstrained Private GLMs "
abstract: " We revisit the well-studied problem of differentially private empirical
  risk minimization (ERM). We show that for unconstrained convex generalized linear
  models (GLMs), one can obtain an excess empirical risk of $\\tilde O\\left(\\sqrt{\\rank}/\\epsilon
  n\\right)$, where $\\rank$ is the rank of the feature matrix in the GLM problem,
  $n$ is the number of data samples, and $\\epsilon$ is the privacy parameter. This
  bound is attained via differentially private gradient descent (DP-GD). Furthermore,
  via the \\emph{first lower bound for unconstrained private ERM}, we show that our
  upper bound is tight. In sharp contrast to the constrained ERM setting, there is
  no dependence on the dimensionality of the ambient model space ($p$). (Notice that
  $\\rank\\leq \\min\\{n, p\\}$.) Besides, we obtain an analogous excess population
  risk bound which depends on $\\rank$ instead of $p$. For the smooth non-convex GLM
  setting (i.e., where the objective function is non-convex but preserves the GLM
  structure), we further show that DP-GD attains a dimension-independent convergence
  of $\\tilde O\\left(\\sqrt{\\rank}/\\epsilon n\\right)$ to a first-order-stationary-point
  of the underlying objective. Finally, we show that for convex GLMs, a variant of
  DP-GD commonly used in practice (which involves clipping the individual gradients)
  also exhibits the same dimension-independent convergence to the minimum of a well-defined
  objective. To that end, we provide a structural lemma that characterizes the effect
  of clipping on the optimization profile of DP-GD. "
