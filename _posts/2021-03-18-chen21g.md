title: " Comparing the Value of Labeled and Unlabeled Data in Method-of-Moments Latent
  Variable Estimation "
abstract: " Labeling data for modern machine learning is expensive and time-consuming.
  Latent variable models can be used to infer labels from weaker, easier-to-acquire
  sources operating on unlabeled data. Such models can also be trained using labeled
  data, presenting a key question: should a user invest in few labeled or many unlabeled
  points? We answer this via a framework centered on model misspecification in method-of-moments
  latent variable estimation. Our core result is a bias-variance decomposition of
  the generalization error, which shows that the unlabeled-only approach incurs additional
  bias under misspecification. We then introduce a correction that provably removes
  this bias in certain cases. We apply our decomposition framework to three scenarios—well-specified,
  misspecified, and corrected models—to 1) choose between labeled and unlabeled data
  and 2) learn from their combination. We observe theoretically and with synthetic
  experiments that for well-specified models, labeled points are worth a constant
  factor more than unlabeled points. With misspecification, however, their relative
  value is higher due to the additional bias but can be reduced with correction. We
  also apply our approach to study real-world weak supervision techniques for dataset
  construction. "
