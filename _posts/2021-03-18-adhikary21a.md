title: " Quantum Tensor Networks, Stochastic Processes, and Weighted Automata "
abstract: " Modeling joint probability distributions over sequences has been studied
  from many perspectives. The physics community developed matrix product states, a
  tensor-train decomposition for probabilistic modeling, motivated by the need to
  tractably model many-body systems. But similar models have also been studied in
  the stochastic processes and weighted automata literature, with little work on how
  these bodies of work relate to each other. We address this gap by showing how stationary
  or uniform versions of popular quantum tensor network models have equivalent representations
  in the stochastic processes and weighted automata literature, in the limit of infinitely
  long sequences. We demonstrate several equivalence results between models used in
  these three communities: (i) uniform variants of matrix product states, Born machines
  and locally purified states from the quantum tensor networks literature, (ii) predictive
  state representations, hidden Markov models, norm-observable operator models and
  hidden quantum Markov models from the stochastic process literature, and (iii) stochastic
  weighted automata, probabilistic automata and quadratic automata from the formal
  languages literature. Such connections may open the door for results and methods
  developed in one area to be applied in another. "
