title: " A Statistical Perspective on Coreset Density Estimation "
abstract: " Coresets have emerged as a powerful tool to summarize data by selecting
  a small subset of the original observations while retaining most of its information.
  This approach has led to significant computational speedups but the performance
  of statistical procedures run on coresets is largely unexplored. In this work, we
  develop a statistical framework to study coresets and focus on the canonical task
  of nonparameteric density estimation. Our contributions are twofold. First, we establish
  the minimax rate of estimation achievable by coreset-based estimators. Second, we
  show that the practical coreset kernel density estimators are near-minimax optimal
  over a large class of Holder-smooth densities. "
