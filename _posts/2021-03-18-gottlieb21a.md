title: " Nested Barycentric Coordinate System as an Explicit Feature Map "
abstract: " We introduce a new embedding technique based on barycentric coordinate
  system. We show that our embedding can be used to transforms the problem of polytope
  approximation into that of finding a \\emph{linear} classifier in a higher (but
  nevertheless quite sparse) dimensional representation. This embedding in effect
  maps a piecewise linear function into a single linear function, and allows us to
  invoke well-known algorithms for the latter problem to solve the former. We demonstrate
  that our embedding has applications to the problems of approximating separating
  polytopes – in fact, it can approximate any convex body and multiple convex bodies
  – as well as to classification by separating polytopes and piecewise linear regression. "
