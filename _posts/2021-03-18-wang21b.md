title: " Shapley Flow: A Graph-based Approach to Interpreting Model Predictions "
abstract: " Many existing approaches for estimating feature importance are problematic
  because they ignore or hide dependencies among features. A causal graph, which encodes
  the relationships among input variables, can aid in assigning feature importance.
  However, current approaches that assign credit to nodes in the causal graph fail
  to explain the entire graph. In light of these limitations, we propose Shapley Flow,
  a novel approach to interpreting machine learning models. It considers the entire
  causal graph, and assigns credit to edges instead of treating nodes as the fundamental
  unit of credit assignment. Shapley Flow is the unique solution to a generalization
  of the Shapley value axioms for directed acyclic graphs. We demonstrate the benefit
  of using Shapley Flow to reason about the impact of a modelâ€™s input on its output.
  In addition to maintaining insights from existing approaches, Shapley Flow extends
  the flat, set-based, view prevalent in game theory based explanation methods to
  a deeper, graph-based, view. This graph-based view enables users to understand the
  flow of importance through a system, and reason about potential interventions. "
