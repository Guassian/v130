title: " Bayesian Coresets: Revisiting the Nonconvex Optimization Perspective "
abstract: " Bayesian coresets have emerged as a promising approach for implementing
  scalable Bayesian inference. The Bayesian coreset problem involves selecting a (weighted)
  subset of the data samples, such that the posterior inference using the selected
  subset closely approximates the posterior inference using the full dataset. This
  manuscript revisits Bayesian coresets through the lens of sparsity constrained optimization.
  Leveraging recent advances in accelerated optimization methods, we propose and analyze
  a novel algorithm for coreset selection. We provide explicit convergence rate guarantees
  and present an empirical evaluation on a variety of benchmark datasets to highlight
  our proposed algorithmâ€™s superior performance compared to state-of-the-art on speed
  and accuracy. "
