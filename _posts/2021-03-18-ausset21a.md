title: " Nearest Neighbour Based Estimates of Gradients: Sharp Nonasymptotic Bounds
  and Applications "
abstract: " Motivated by a wide variety of applications, ranging from stochastic optimization
  to dimension reduction through variable selection, the problem of estimating gradients
  accurately is of crucial importance in statistics and learning theory. We consider
  here the classic regression setup, where a real valued square integrable r.v. Y
  is to be predicted upon observing a (possibly high dimensional) random vector X
  by means of a predictive function f(X) as accurately as possible in the mean-squared
  sense and study a nearest-neighbour-based pointwise estimate of the gradient of
  the optimal predictive function, the regression function m(x)=E[Y | X=x]. Under
  classic smoothness conditions combined with the assumption that the tails of Y-m(X)
  are sub-Gaussian, we prove nonasymptotic bounds improving upon those obtained for
  alternative estimation methods. Beyond the novel theoretical results established,
  several illustrative numerical experiments have been carried out. The latter provide
  strong empirical evidence that the estimation method proposed works very well for
  various statistical problems involving gradient estimation, namely dimensionality
  reduction, stochastic gradient descent optimization and quantifying disentanglement. "
