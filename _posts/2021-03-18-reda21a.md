title: " Top-m identification for linear bandits "
abstract: " Motivated by an application to drug repurposing, we propose the first
  algorithms to tackle the identification of the m ≥ 1 arms with largest means in
  a linear bandit model, in the fixed-confidence setting. These algorithms belong
  to the generic family of Gap-Index Focused Algorithms (GIFA) that we introduce for
  Top-m identification in linear bandits. We propose a unified analysis of these algorithms,
  which shows how the use of contexts might decrease the sample complexity. We further
  validate these algorithms empirically on simulated data and on a simple drug repurposing
  task. "
