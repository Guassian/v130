title: " Selective Classification via One-Sided Prediction "
abstract: " We propose a novel method for selective classification (SC), a problem
  which allows a classifier to abstain from predicting some instances, thus trading
  off accuracy against coverage (the fraction of instances predicted). In contrast
  to prior gating or confidence-set based work, our proposed method optimises a collection
  of class-wise decoupled one-sided empirical risks, and is in essence a method for
  explicitly finding the largest decision sets for each class that have few false
  positives. This one-sided prediction (OSP) based relaxation yields an SC scheme
  that attains near-optimal coverage in the practically relevant high target accuracy
  regime, and further admits efficient implementation, leading to a flexible and principled
  method for SC. We theoretically derive generalization bounds for SC and OSP, and
  empirically we show that our scheme strongly outperforms state of the art methods
  in coverage at small error levels. "
