title: " On the Faster Alternating Least-Squares for CCA "
abstract: " We study alternating least-squares (ALS) for canonical correlation analysis
  (CCA). Recent research shows that the alternating least-squares solver for k-CCA
  can be directly accelerated with momentum and prominent performance gain has been
  observed in practice for the resulting simple algorithm. However, despite the simplicity,
  it is difficult for the accelerated rate to be analyzed in theory in order to explain
  and match the empirical performance gain. By looking into two neighboring iterations,
  in this work, we propose an even simpler variant of the faster alternating least-squares
  solver. Instead of applying momentum to each update for acceleration, the proposed
  variant only leverages momentum at every other iteration and can converge at a provably
  faster linear rate of nearly square-root dependence on the singular value gap of
  the whitened cross-covariance matrix. In addition to the high consistency between
  theory and practice, experimental studies also show that our variant of the alternating
  least-squares algorithm as a block CCA solver is even more pass efficient than other
  variants. "
