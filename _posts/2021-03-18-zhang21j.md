title: " Product Manifold Learning "
abstract: " We consider dimensionality reduction for data sets with two or more independent
  degrees of freedom. For example, measurements of deformable shapes with several
  parts that move independently fall under this characterization. Mathematically,
  if the space of each continuous independent motion is a manifold, then their combination
  forms a product manifold. In this paper, we present an algorithm for manifold factorization
  given a sample of points from the product manifold. Our algorithm is based on spectral
  graph methods for manifold learning and the separability of the Laplacian operator
  on product spaces. Recovering the factors of a manifold yields meaningful lower-dimensional
  representations, allowing one to focus on particular aspects of the data space while
  ignoring others. We demonstrate the potential use of our method for an important
  and challenging problem in structural biology: mapping the motions of proteins and
  other large molecules using cryo-electron microscopy data sets. "
