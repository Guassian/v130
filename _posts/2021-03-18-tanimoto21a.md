title: " Regret Minimization for Causal Inference on Large Treatment Space "
abstract: " Predicting which action (treatment) will lead to a better outcome is a
  central task in decision support systems. To build a prediction model in real situations,
  learning from observational data with a sampling bias is a critical issue due to
  the lack of randomized controlled trial (RCT) data. To handle such biased observational
  data, recent efforts in causal inference and counterfactual machine learning have
  focused on debiased estimation of the potential outcomes on a binary action space
  and the difference between them, namely, the individual treatment effect. When it
  comes to a large action space (e.g., selecting an appropriate combination of medicines
  for a patient), however, the regression accuracy of the potential outcomes is no
  longer sufficient in practical terms to achieve a good decision-making performance.
  This is because a high mean accuracy on the large action space does not guarantee
  the nonexistence of a single potential outcome misestimation that misleads the whole
  decision. Our proposed loss minimizes the classification error of whether or not
  the action is relatively good for the individual target among all feasible actions,
  which further improves the decision-making performance, as we demonstrate. We also
  propose a network architecture and a regularizer that extracts a debiased representation
  not only from the individual feature but also from the biased action for better
  generalization in large action spaces. Extensive experiments on synthetic and semi-synthetic
  datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method for large combinatorial action
  spaces. "
