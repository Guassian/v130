title: " Neural Empirical Bayes: Source Distribution Estimation and its Applications
  to Simulation-Based Inference "
abstract: " We revisit g-modeling empirical Bayes in the absence of a tractable likelihood
  function, as is typical in scientific domains relying on computer simulations. We
  investigate how the empirical Bayesian can make use of neural density estimators
  first to use all noise-corrupted observations to estimate a prior or source distribution
  over uncorrupted samples, and then to perform single-observation posterior inference
  using the fitted source distribution. We propose an approach based on the direct
  maximization of the log-marginal likelihood of the observations, examining both
  biased and de-biased estimators, and comparing to variational approaches. We find
  that, up to symmetries, a neural empirical Bayes approach recovers ground truth
  source distributions. With the learned source distribution in hand, we show the
  applicability to likelihood-free inference and examine the quality of the resulting
  posterior estimates. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of Neural Empirical
  Bayes on an inverse problem from collider physics. "
