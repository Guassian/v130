title: " Online Robust Control of Nonlinear Systems with Large Uncertainty "
abstract: " Robust control is a core approach for controlling systems with performance
  guarantees that are robust to modeling error, and is widely used in real-world systems.
  However, current robust control approaches can only handle small system uncertainty,
  and thus require significant effort in system identification prior to controller
  design. We present an online approach that robustly controls a nonlinear system
  under large model uncertainty. Our approach is based on decomposing the problem
  into two sub-problems, “robust control design” (which assumes small model uncertainty)
  and “chasing consistent models”, which can be solved using existing tools from control
  theory and online learning, respectively. We provide a learning convergence analysis
  that yields a finite mistake bound on the number of times performance requirements
  are not met and can provide strong safety guarantees, by bounding the worst-case
  state deviation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach for online
  robust control of nonlinear systems with such learning theoretic and safety guarantees.
  We also show how to instantiate this framework for general robotic systems, demonstrating
  the practicality of our approach. "
