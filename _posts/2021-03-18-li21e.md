title: " One-Sketch-for-All: Non-linear Random Features from Compressed Linear Measurements "
abstract: " The commonly used Gaussian kernel has a tuning parameter $\\gamma$. This
  makes the design of quantization schemes for random Fourier features (RFF) challenging,
  which is a popular technique to approximate the Gaussian kernel. Intuitively one
  would expect that a different quantizer is needed for a different $\\gamma$ value
  (and we need to store a different set of quantized data for each $\\gamma$). Fortunately,
  the recent work \\citep{Report:Li_2021_RFF} showed that only one Lloyd-Max (LM)
  quantizer is needed as the marginal distribution of RFF is free of the tuning parameter
  $\\gamma$. On the other hand, \\citet{Report:Li_2021_RFF} still required to store
  a different set of quantized data for each $\\gamma$ value. In this paper, we adopt
  the “one-sketch-for-all” strategy for quantizing RFFs. Basically, we only store
  one set of quantized data after applying random projections on the original data.
  From the same set of quantized data, we can construct approximate RFFs to approximate
  Gaussian kernels for any tuning parameter $\\gamma$. Compared with \\citet{Report:Li_2021_RFF},
  our proposed scheme would lose some accuracy as one would expect. Nevertheless,
  the proposed method still perform noticeably better than the quantization scheme
  based on random rounding. We provide statistical analysis on the properties of the
  proposed method and experiments are conducted to empirically illustrate its effectiveness. "
