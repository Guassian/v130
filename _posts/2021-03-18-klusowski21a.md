title: " Nonparametric Variable Screening with Optimal Decision Stumps "
abstract: " Decision trees and their ensembles are endowed with a rich set of diagnostic
  tools for ranking and screening variables in a predictive model. Despite the widespread
  use of tree based variable importance measures, pinning down their theoretical properties
  has been challenging and therefore largely unexplored. To address this gap between
  theory and practice, we derive finite sample performance guarantees for variable
  selection in nonparametric models using a single-level CART decision tree (a decision
  stump). Under standard operating assumptions in variable screening literature, we
  find that the marginal signal strength of each variable and ambient dimensionality
  can be considerably weaker and higher, respectively, than state-of-the-art nonparametric
  variable selection methods. Furthermore, unlike previous marginal screening methods
  that estimate each marginal projection via a truncated basis expansion, the fitted
  model used here is a simple, parsimonious decision stump, thereby eliminating the
  need for tuning the number of basis terms. Thus, surprisingly, even though decision
  stumps are highly inaccurate for estimation purposes, they can still be used to
  perform consistent model selection. "
