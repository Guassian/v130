title: " Causal Inference with Selectively Deconfounded Data "
abstract: " Given only data generated by a standard confounding graph with unobserved
  confounder, the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) is not identifiable. To estimate
  the ATE, a practitioner must then either (a) collect deconfounded data; (b) run
  a clinical trial; or (c) elucidate further properties of the causal graph that might
  render the ATE identifiable. In this paper, we consider the benefit of incorporating
  a large confounded observational dataset (confounder unobserved) alongside a small
  deconfounded observational dataset (confounder revealed) when estimating the ATE.
  Our theoretical results suggest that the inclusion of confounded data can significantly
  reduce the quantity of deconfounded data required to estimate the ATE to within
  a desired accuracy level. Moreover, in some cases—say, genetics—we could imagine
  retrospectively selecting samples to deconfound. We demonstrate that by actively
  selecting these samples based upon the (already observed) treatment and outcome,
  we can reduce sample complexity further. Our theoretical and empirical results establish
  that the worst-case relative performance of our approach (vs. a natural benchmark)
  is bounded while our best-case gains are unbounded. Finally, we demonstrate the
  benefits of selective deconfounding using a large real-world dataset related to
  genetic mutation in cancer. "
