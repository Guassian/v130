title: " Continual Learning using a Bayesian Nonparametric Dictionary of Weight Factors "
abstract: " Naively trained neural networks tend to experience catastrophic forgetting
  in sequential task settings, where data from previous tasks are unavailable. A number
  of methods, using various model expansion strategies, have been proposed recently
  as possible solutions. However, determining how much to expand the model is left
  to the practitioner, and often a constant schedule is chosen for simplicity, regardless
  of how complex the incoming task is. Instead, we propose a principled Bayesian nonparametric
  approach based on the Indian Buffet Process (IBP) prior, letting the data determine
  how much to expand the model complexity. We pair this with a factorization of the
  neural networkâ€™s weight matrices. Such an approach allows us to scale the number
  of factors of each weight matrix to the complexity of the task, while the IBP prior
  encourages sparse weight factor selection and factor reuse, promoting positive knowledge
  transfer between tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a number
  of continual learning benchmarks and analyze how weight factors are allocated and
  reused throughout the training. "
