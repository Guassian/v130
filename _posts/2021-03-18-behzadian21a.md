title: " Optimizing Percentile Criterion using Robust MDPs "
abstract: " We address the problem of computing reliable policies in reinforcement
  learning problems with limited data. In particular, we compute policies that achieve
  good returns with high confidence when deployed. This objective, known as the percentile
  criterion, can be optimized using Robust MDPs (RMDPs). RMDPs generalize MDPs to
  allow for uncertain transition probabilities chosen adversarially from given ambiguity
  sets. We show that the RMDP solutionâ€™s sub-optimality depends on the spans of the
  ambiguity sets along the value function. We then propose new algorithms that minimize
  the span of ambiguity sets defined by weighted L1 and L-infinity norms. Our primary
  focus is on Bayesian guarantees, but we also describe how our methods apply to frequentist
  guarantees and derive new concentration inequalities for weighted L1 and L-infinity
  norms. Experimental results indicate that our optimized ambiguity sets improve significantly
  on prior construction methods. "
