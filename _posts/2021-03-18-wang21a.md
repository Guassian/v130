title: " A comparative study on sampling with replacement vs Poisson sampling in optimal
  subsampling "
abstract: " Faced with massive data, subsampling is a commonly used technique to improve
  computational efficiency, and using nonuniform subsampling probabilities is an effective
  approach to improve estimation efficiency. For computational efficiency, subsampling
  is often implemented with replacement or through Poisson subsampling. However, no
  rigorous investigation has been performed to study the difference between the two
  subsampling procedures such as their estimation efficiency and computational convenience.
  In the context of maximizing a general target function, this paper derives optimal
  subsampling probabilities for both subsampling with replacement and Poisson subsampling.
  The optimal subsampling probabilities minimize variance functions of the subsampling
  estimators. Furthermore, they provide deep insights on the theoretical similarities
  and differences between subsampling with replacement and Poisson subsampling. Practically
  implementable algorithms are proposed based on the optimal structural results, which
  are evaluated by both theoretical and empirical analysis. "
