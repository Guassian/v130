title: " Noise Contrastive Meta-Learning for Conditional Density Estimation using
  Kernel Mean Embeddings "
abstract: " Current meta-learning approaches focus on learning functional representations
  of relationships between variables, \\textit{i.e.} estimating conditional expectations
  in regression. In many applications, however, the conditional distributions cannot
  be meaningfully summarized solely by expectation (due to \\textit{e.g.} multimodality).
  We introduce a novel technique for meta-learning conditional densities, which combines
  neural representation and noise contrastive estimation together with well-established
  literature in conditional mean embeddings into reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.
  The method shows significant improvements over standard density estimation methods
  on synthetic and real-world data, by leveraging shared representations across multiple
  conditional density estimation tasks. "
