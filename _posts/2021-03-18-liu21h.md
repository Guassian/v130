title: " Contrastive learning of strong-mixing continuous-time stochastic processes "
abstract: " Contrastive learning is a family of self-supervised methods where a model
  is trained to solve a classification task constructed from unlabeled data. It has
  recently emerged as one of the leading learning paradigms in the absence of labels
  across many different domains (e.g. brain imaging, text, images). However, theoretical
  understanding of many aspects of training, both statistical and algorithmic, remain
  fairly elusive. In this work, we study the setting of time seriesâ€”more precisely,
  when we get data from a strong-mixing continuous-time stochastic process. We show
  that a properly constructed contrastive learning task can be used to the transition
  kernel for small-to-mid-range intervals in the diffusion case. Moreover, we give
  sample complexity bounds for solving this task and quantitatively characterize what
  the value of the contrastive loss implies for distributional closeness of the learned
  kernel. As a byproduct, we illuminate the appropriate settings for the contrastive
  distribution, as well as other hyperparameters in this setup. "
