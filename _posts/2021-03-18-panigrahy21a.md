title: " Sketch based Memory for Neural Networks "
abstract: " Deep learning has shown tremendous success on a variety of problems. However,
  unlike traditional computational paradigm, most neural networks do not have access
  to a memory, which might be hampering its ability to scale to large data structures
  such as graphs, lookup-tables, databases. We propose a neural architecture where
  sketch based memory is integrated into a neural network in a uniform manner at every
  layer. This architecture supplements a neural layer by information accessed from
  the memory before feeding it to the next layer, thereby significantly expanding
  the capacity of the network to solve larger problem instances. We show theoretically
  that problems involving key-value lookup that are traditionally stored in standard
  databases can now be solved using neural networks augmented by our memory architecture.
  We also show that our memory layer can be viewed as a kernel function. We show benefits
  on diverse problems such as long tail image classification, language model, large
  graph multi hop traversal, etc. arguing that they are all build upon the classical
  key-value lookup problem (or the variant where the keys may be fuzzy). "
