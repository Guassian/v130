title: " Detection and Defense of Topological Adversarial Attacks on Graphs "
abstract: " Graph neural network (GNN) models achieve superior performance when classifying
  nodes in graph-structured data. Given that state-of-the-art GNNs share many similarities
  with their CNN cousins and that CNNs suffer adversarial vulnerabilities, there has
  also been interest in exploring analogous vulnerabilities in GNNs. Indeed, recent
  work has demonstrated that node classification performance of several graph models,
  including the popular graph convolution network (GCN) model, can be severely degraded
  through adversarial perturbations to the graph structure and the node features.
  In this work, we take a first step towards detecting adversarial attacks against
  graph models. We first propose a straightforward single node threshold test for
  detecting nodes subject to targeted attacks. Subsequently, we describe a kernel-based
  two-sample test for detecting whether a given subset of nodes within a graph has
  been maliciously corrupted. The efficacy of our algorithms is established via thorough
  experiments using commonly used node classification benchmark datasets. We also
  illustrate the potential practical benefit of our detection method by demonstrating
  its application to a real-world Bitcoin transaction network. "
