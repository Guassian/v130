title: " Fast Learning in Reproducing Kernel Krein Spaces via Signed Measures "
abstract: " In this paper, we attempt to solve a long-lasting open question for non-positive
  definite (non-PD) kernels in machine learning community: can a given non-PD kernel
  be decomposed into the difference of two PD kernels (termed as positive decomposition)?
  We cast this question as a distribution view by introducing the signed measure,
  which transforms positive decomposition to measure decomposition: a series of non-PD
  kernels can be associated with the linear combination of specific finite Borel measures.
  In this manner, our distribution-based framework provides a sufficient and necessary
  condition to answer this open question. Specifically, this solution is also computationally
  implementable in practice to scale non-PD kernels in large sample cases, which allows
  us to devise the first random features algorithm to obtain an unbiased estimator.
  Experimental results on several benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our
  algorithm over the existing methods. "
