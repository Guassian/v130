title: " Significance of Gradient Information in Bayesian Optimization "
abstract: " We consider the problem of Bayesian Optimization (BO) in which the goal
  is to design an adaptive querying strategy to optimize a function $f:[0,1]^d\\mapsto
  \\reals$. The function is assumed to be drawn from a Gaussian Process, and can only
  be accessed through noisy oracle queries. The most commonly used oracle in BO literature
  is the noisy Zeroth-Order-Oracle (ZOO) which returns noise-corrupted function value
  $y = f(x) + \\eta$ at any point $x \\in \\domain$ queried by the agent. A less studied
  oracle in BO is the First-Order-Oracle (FOO) which also returns noisy gradient value
  at the queried point. In this paper we consider the fundamental question of quantifying
  the possible improvement in regret that can be achieved under FOO access as compared
  to the case in which only ZOO access is available. Under some regularity assumptions
  on $K$, we first show that the expected cumulative regret with ZOO of any algorithm
  must satisfy a lower bound of $\\Omega(\\sqrt{2^d n})$, where $n$ is the query budget.
  This lower bound captures the appropriate scaling of the regret on both dimension
  $d$ and budget $n$, and relies on a novel reduction from BO to a multi-armed bandit (MAB)
  problem. We then propose a two-phase algorithm which, with some additional prior
  knowledge, achieves a vastly improved $\\mc{O}\\lp d (\\log n)^2 \\rp$ regret when
  given access to a FOO. Together, these two results highlight the significant value
  of incorporating gradient information in BO algorithms. "
