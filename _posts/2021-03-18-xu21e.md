title: " Learning Matching Representations for Individualized Organ Transplantation
  Allocation "
abstract: " Organ transplantation can improve life expectancy for recipients, but
  the probability of a successful transplant depends on the compatibility between
  donor and recipient features. Current medical practice relies on coarse rules for
  donor-recipient matching, but is short of domain knowledge regarding the complex
  factors underlying organ compatibility. In this paper, we formulate the problem
  of learning data-driven rules for donor-recipient matching using observational data
  for organ allocations and transplant outcomes. This problem departs from the standard
  supervised learning setup in that it involves matching two feature spaces (for donors
  and recipients), and requires estimating transplant outcomes under counterfactual
  matches not observed in the data. To address this problem, we propose a model based
  on representation learning to predict donor-recipient compatibilityâ€”our model learns
  representations that cluster donor features, and applies donor-invariant transformations
  to recipient features to predict transplant outcomes under a given donor-recipient
  feature instance. Experiments on several semi-synthetic and real-world datasets
  show that our model outperforms state-of-art allocation models and real-world policies
  executed by human experts. "
