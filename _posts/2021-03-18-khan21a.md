title: " Self-Supervised Steering Angle Prediction for Vehicle Control Using Visual
  Odometry "
abstract: " Vision-based learning methods for self-driving cars have primarily used
  supervised approaches that require a large number of labels for training. However,
  those labels are usually difficult and expensive to obtain. In this paper, we demonstrate
  how a model can be trained to control a vehicleâ€™s trajectory using camera poses
  estimated through visual odometry methods in an entirely self-supervised fashion.
  We propose a scalable framework that leverages trajectory information from several
  different runs using a camera setup placed at the front of a car. Experimental results
  on the CARLA simulator demonstrate that our proposed approach performs at par with
  the model trained with supervision. "
