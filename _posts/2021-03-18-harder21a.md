title: " DP-MERF: Differentially Private Mean Embeddings with RandomFeatures for Practical
  Privacy-preserving Data Generation "
abstract: " We propose a differentially private data generation paradigm using random
  feature representations of kernel mean embeddings when comparing the distribution
  of true data with that of synthetic data. We exploit the random feature representations
  for two important benefits. First, we require a minimal privacy cost for training
  deep generative models. This is because unlike kernel-based distance metrics that
  require computing the kernel matrix on all pairs of true and synthetic data points,
  we can detach the data-dependent term from the term solely dependent on synthetic
  data. Hence, we need to perturb the data-dependent term once and for all and then
  use it repeatedly during the generator training. Second, we can obtain an analytic
  sensitivity of the kernel mean embedding as the random features are norm bounded
  by construction. This removes the necessity of hyper-parameter search for a clipping
  norm to handle the unknown sensitivity of a generator network. We provide several
  variants of our algorithm, differentially-private mean embeddings with random features
  (DP-MERF) to jointly generate labels and input features for datasets such as heterogeneous
  tabular data and image data. Our algorithm achieves drastically better privacy-utility
  trade-offs than existing methods when tested on several datasets. "
