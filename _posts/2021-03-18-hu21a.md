title: " Regularization Matters: A Nonparametric Perspective on Overparametrized Neural
  Network "
abstract: " Overparametrized neural networks trained by gradient descent (GD) can
  provably overfit any training data. However, the generalization guarantee may not
  hold for noisy data. From a nonparametric perspective, this paper studies how well
  overparametrized neural networks can recover the true target function in the presence
  of random noises. We establish a lower bound on the L2 estimation error with respect
  to the GD iteration, which is away from zero without a delicate choice of early
  stopping. In turn, through a comprehensive analysis of L2-regularized GD trajectories,
  we prove that for overparametrized one-hidden-layer ReLU neural network with the
  L2 regularization: (1) the output is close to that of the kernel ridge regression
  with the corresponding neural tangent kernel; (2) minimax optimal rate of the L2
  estimation error is achieved. Numerical experiments confirm our theory and further
  demonstrate that the L2 regularization approach improves the training robustness
  and works for a wider range of neural networks. "
