title: " Finding First-Order Nash Equilibria of Zero-Sum Games with the Regularized
  Nikaido-Isoda Function "
abstract: " Efficiently finding First-order Nash Equilibria (FNE) in zero-sum games
  can be challenging, even in a two-player setting. This work proposes an algorithm
  for finding the FNEs of a two-player zero-sum game, in which the local cost functions
  can be non-convex, and the players only have access to local stochastic gradients.
  The proposed approach is based on reformulating the problem of interest as minimizing
  the Regularized Nikaido-Isoda (RNI) function. We show that the global minima of
  the RNI correspond to the set of FNEs, and that for certain classes of non-convex
  games the RNI minimization problem becomes convex. Moreover, we introduce a first-order
  (stochastic) optimization method, and establish its convergence to a neighborhood
  of a stationary solution of the RNI objective. The key in the analysis is to properly
  control the bias between the local stochastic gradient and the true one. Although
  the RNI function has been used in analyzing convex games, to our knowledge, this
  is the first time that the properties of the RNI formulation have been exploited
  to find FNEs for non-convex games in a stochastic setting. "
