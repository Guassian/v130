title: " Revisiting Model-Agnostic Private Learning: Faster Rates and Active Learning "
abstract: " The Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE) framework is one of
  the most promising recent approaches in differentially private learning. Existing
  theoretical analysis shows that PATE consistently learns any VC-classes in the realizable
  setting, but falls short in explaining its success in more general cases where the
  error rate of the optimal classifier is bounded away from zero. We fill in this
  gap by introducing the Tsybakov Noise Condition (TNC) and establish stronger and
  more interpretable learning bounds. These bounds provide new insights into when
  PATE works and improve over existing results even in the narrower realizable setting.
  We also investigate the compelling idea of using active learning for saving privacy
  budget. The novel components in the proofs include a more refined analysis of the
  majority voting classifier — which could be of independent interest — and an observation
  that the synthetic “student” learning problem is nearly realizable by construction
  under the Tsybakov noise condition. "
