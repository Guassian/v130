title: " Robust Learning under Strong Noise via SQs "
abstract: " This work provides several new insights on the robustness of Kearns’ statistical
  query framework against challenging label-noise models. First, we build on a recent
  result by \\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2006-04787} that showed noise tolerance
  of distribution-independently evolvable concept classes under Massart noise. Specifically,
  we extend their characterization to more general noise models, including the Tsybakov
  model which considerably generalizes the Massart condition by allowing the flipping
  probability to be arbitrarily close to $\\frac{1}{2}$ for a subset of the domain.
  As a corollary, we employ an evolutionary algorithm by \\cite{DBLP:conf/colt/KanadeVV10}
  to obtain the first polynomial time algorithm with arbitrarily small excess error
  for learning linear threshold functions over any spherically symmetric distribution
  in the presence of spherically symmetric Tsybakov noise. Moreover, we posit access
  to a stronger oracle, in which for every labeled example we additionally obtain
  its flipping probability. In this model, we show that every SQ learnable class admits
  an efficient learning algorithm with $\\opt + \\epsilon$ misclassification error
  for a broad class of noise models. This setting substantially generalizes the widely-studied
  problem of classification under RCN with known noise rate, and corresponds to a
  non-convex optimization problem even when the noise function – i.e. the flipping
  probabilities of all points – is known in advance. "
