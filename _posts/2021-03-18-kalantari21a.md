title: " Graph Gamma Process Linear Dynamical Systems "
abstract: " We introduce graph gamma process (GGP) linear dynamical systems to model
  real-valued multivariate time series. GGP generates $S$ latent states that are shared
  by $K$ different communities, each of which is characterized by its own pattern
  of activation probabilities imposed on a $S\\times S$ directed sparse graph, and
  allow both $S$ and $K$ to grow without bound. For temporal pattern discovery, the
  latent representation under the model is used to decompose the time series into
  a parsimonious set of multivariate sub-sequences generated by formed communities.
  In each sub-sequence, different data dimensions often share similar temporal patterns
  but may exhibit distinct magnitudes, and hence allowing the superposition of all
  sub-sequences to exhibit diverse behaviors at different data dimensions. On both
  synthetic and real-world time series, the proposed nonparametric Bayesian dynamic
  models, which are initialized at random, consistently exhibit good predictive performance
  in comparison to a variety of baseline models, revealing interpretable latent state
  transition patterns and decomposing the time series into distinctly behaved sub-sequences. "
