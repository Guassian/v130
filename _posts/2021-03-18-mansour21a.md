title: " A Theory of Multiple-Source Adaptation with Limited Target Labeled Data "
abstract: " We study multiple-source domain adaptation, when the learner has access
  to abundant labeled data from multiple-source domains and limited labeled data from
  the target domain. We analyze existing algorithms for this problem, and propose
  a novel algorithm based on model selection. Our algorithms are efficient, and experiments
  on real data-sets empirically demonstrate their benefits. "
