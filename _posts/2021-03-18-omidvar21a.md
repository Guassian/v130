title: " Associative Convolutional Layers "
abstract: " We provide a general and easy to implement method for reducing the number
  of parameters of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) during the training and inference
  phases. We introduce a simple trainable auxiliary neural network which can generate
  approximate versions of “slices” of the sets of convolutional filters of any CNN
  architecture from a low dimensional “code” space. These slices are then concatenated
  to form the sets of filters in the CNN architecture. The auxiliary neural network,
  which we call “Convolutional Slice Generator” (CSG), is unique to the network and
  provides the association among its convolutional layers. We apply our method to
  various CNN architectures including ResNet, DenseNet, MobileNet and ShuffleNet.
  Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1000, without any hyper-parameter tuning, show
  that our approach reduces the network parameters by approximately $2\\times$ while
  the reduction in accuracy is confined to within one percent and sometimes the accuracy
  even improves after compression. Interestingly, through our experiments, we show
  that even when the CSG takes random binary values for its weights that are not learned,
  still acceptable performances are achieved. To show that our approach generalizes
  to other tasks, we apply it to an image segmentation architecture, Deeplab V3, on
  the Pascal VOC 2012 dataset. Results show that without any parameter tuning, there
  is $\\approx 2.3\\times$ parameter reduction and the mean Intersection over Union
  (mIoU) drops by $\\approx 3%$. Finally, we provide comparisons with several related
  methods showing the superiority of our method in terms of accuracy. "
