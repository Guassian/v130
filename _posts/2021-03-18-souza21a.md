title: " Learning GPLVM with arbitrary kernels using the unscented transformation "
abstract: " Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model (GPLVM) is a flexible framework
  to handle uncertain inputs in Gaussian Processes (GPs) and incorporate GPs as components
  of larger graphical models. Nonetheless, the standard GPLVM variational inference
  approach is tractable only for a narrow family of kernel functions. The most popular
  implementations of GPLVM circumvent this limitation using quadrature methods, which
  may become a computational bottleneck even for relatively low dimensions. For instance,
  the widely employed Gauss-Hermite quadrature has exponential complexity on the number
  of dimensions. In this work, we propose using the unscented transformation instead.
  Overall, this method presents comparable, if not better, performance than off-the-shelf
  solutions to GPLVM, and its computational complexity scales only linearly on dimension.
  In contrast to Monte Carlo methods, our approach is deterministic and works well
  with quasi-Newton methods, such as the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm.
  We illustrate the applicability of our method with experiments on dimensionality
  reduction and multistep-ahead prediction with uncertainty propagation. "
