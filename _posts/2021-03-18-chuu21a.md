title: " A Hybrid Approximation to the Marginal Likelihood "
abstract: " Computing the marginal likelihood or evidence is one of the core challenges
  in Bayesian analysis. While there are many established methods for estimating this
  quantity, they predominantly rely on using a large number of posterior samples obtained
  from a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. As the dimension of the parameter
  space increases, however, many of these methods become prohibitively slow and potentially
  inaccurate. In this paper, we propose a novel method in which we use the MCMC samples
  to learn a high probability partition of the parameter space and then form a deterministic
  approximation over each of these partition sets. This two-step procedure, which
  constitutes both a probabilistic and a deterministic component, is termed a Hybrid
  approximation to the marginal likelihood. We demonstrate its versatility in a plethora
  of examples with varying dimension and sample size, and we also highlight the Hybrid
  approximationâ€™s effectiveness in situations where there is either a limited number
  or only approximate MCMC samples available. "
