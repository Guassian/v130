title: " Kernel Distributionally Robust Optimization: Generalized Duality Theorem
  and Stochastic Approximation "
abstract: " We propose kernel distributionally robust optimization (Kernel DRO) using
  insights from the robust optimization theory and functional analysis. Our method
  uses reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) to construct a wide range of convex
  ambiguity sets, which can be generalized to sets based on integral probability metrics
  and finite-order moment bounds. This perspective unifies multiple existing robust
  and stochastic optimization methods. We prove a theorem that generalizes the classical
  duality in the mathematical problem of moments. Enabled by this theorem, we reformulate
  the maximization with respect to measures in DRO into the dual program that searches
  for RKHS functions. Using universal RKHSs, the theorem applies to a broad class
  of loss functions, lifting common limitations such as polynomial losses and knowledge
  of the Lipschitz constant. We then establish a connection between DRO and stochastic
  optimization with expectation constraints. Finally, we propose practical algorithms
  based on both batch convex solvers and stochastic functional gradient, which apply
  to general optimization and machine learning tasks. "
