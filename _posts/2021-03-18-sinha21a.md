title: " Multi-Armed Bandits with Cost Subsidy "
abstract: " In this paper, we consider a novel variant of the multi-armed bandit (MAB)
  problem, MAB with cost subsidy, which models many real-life applications where the
  learning agent has to pay to select an arm and is concerned about optimizing cumulative
  costs and rewards. We present two applications, intelligent SMS routing problem
  and ad audience optimization problem faced by several businesses (especially online
  platforms), and show how our problem uniquely captures key features of these applications.
  We show that naive generalizations of existing MAB algorithms like Upper Confidence
  Bound and Thompson Sampling do not perform well for this problem. We then establish
  a fundamental lower bound on the performance of any online learning algorithm for
  this problem, highlighting the hardness of our problem in comparison to the classical
  MAB problem. We also present a simple variant of explore-then-commit and establish
  near-optimal regret bounds for this algorithm. Lastly, we perform extensive numerical
  simulations to understand the behavior of a suite of algorithms for various instances
  and recommend a practical guide to employ different algorithms. "
