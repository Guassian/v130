title: " Fast Adaptation with Linearized Neural Networks "
abstract: " The inductive biases of trained neural networks are difficult to understand
  and, consequently, to adapt to new settings. We study the inductive biases of linearizations
  of neural networks, which we show to be surprisingly good summaries of the full
  network functions. Inspired by this finding, we propose a technique for embedding
  these inductive biases into Gaussian processes through a kernel designed from the
  Jacobian of the network. In this setting, domain adaptation takes the form of interpretable
  posterior inference, with accompanying uncertainty estimation. This inference is
  analytic and free of local optima issues found in standard techniques such as fine-tuning
  neural network weights to a new task. We develop significant computational speed-ups
  based on matrix multiplies, including a novel implementation for scalable Fisher
  vector products. Our experiments on both image classification and regression demonstrate
  the promise and convenience of this framework for transfer learning, compared to
  neural network fine-tuning. "
