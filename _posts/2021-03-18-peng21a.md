title: " Regression Discontinuity Design under Self-selection "
abstract: " Regression Discontinuity (RD) design is commonly used to estimate the
  causal effect of a policy. Existing RD relies on the continuity assumption of potential
  outcomes. However, self selection leads to different distributions of covariates
  on two sides of the policy intervention, which violates this assumption. The standard
  RD estimators are no longer applicable in such setting. We show that the direct
  causal effect can still be recovered under a class of weighted average treatment
  effects. We propose a set of estimators through a weighted local linear regression
  framework and prove the consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimators.
  We apply our method to a novel data set from Microsoft Bing on Generalized Second
  Price (GSP) auction and show that by placing the advertisement on the second ranked
  position can increase the click-ability by 1.91%. "
