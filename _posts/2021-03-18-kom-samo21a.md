title: " Inductive Mutual Information Estimation: A Convex Maximum-Entropy Copula
  Approach "
abstract: " We propose a novel estimator of the mutual information between two ordinal
  vectors $x$ and $y$. Our approach is inductive (as opposed to deductive) in that
  it depends on the data generating distribution solely through some nonparametric
  properties revealing associations in the data, and does not require having enough
  data to fully characterize the true joint distributions $P_{x, y}$. Specifically,
  our approach consists of (i) noting that $I\\left(y; x\\right) = I\\left(u_y; u_x\\right)$
  where $u_y$ and $u_x$ are the copula-uniform dual representations of $y$ and $x$
  (i.e. their images under the probability integral transform), and (ii) estimating
  the copula entropies $h\\left(u_y\\right)$, $h\\left(u_x\\right)$ and $h\\left(u_y,
  u_x\\right)$ by solving a maximum-entropy problem over the space of copula densities
  under a constraint of the type $\\alpha_m = E\\left[\\phi_m(u_y, u_x)\\right]$.
  We prove that, so long as the constraint is feasible, this problem admits a unique
  solution, it is in the exponential family, and it can be learned by solving a convex
  optimization problem. The resulting estimator, which we denote MIND, is marginal-invariant,
  always non-negative, unbounded for any sample size $n$, consistent, has MSE rate
  $O(1/n)$, and is more data-efficient than competing approaches. "
