title: " Local Stochastic Gradient Descent Ascent: Convergence Analysis and Communication
  Efficiency "
abstract: " Local SGD is a promising approach to overcome the communication overhead
  in distributed learning by reducing the synchronization frequency among worker nodes.
  Despite the recent theoretical advances of local SGD in empirical risk minimization,
  the efficiency of its counterpart in minimax optimization remains unexplored. Motivated
  by large scale minimax learning problems, such as adversarial robust learning and
  GANs, we propose local Stochastic Gradient Descent Ascent (local SGDA), where the
  primal and dual variables can be trained locally and averaged periodically to significantly
  reduce the number of communications. We show that local SGDA can provably optimize
  distributed minimax problems in both homogeneous and heterogeneous data with reduced
  number of communications and establish convergence rates under strongly-convex-strongly-concave
  and nonconvex-strongly-concave settings. In addition, we propose a novel variant,
  dubbed as local SGDA+, to solve nonconvex-nonconcave problems. We also give corroborating
  empirical evidence on different distributed minimax problems. "
