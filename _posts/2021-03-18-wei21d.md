title: " Learning Infinite-horizon Average-reward MDPs with Linear Function Approximation "
abstract: " We develop several new algorithms for learning Markov Decision Processes
  in an infinite-horizon average-reward setting with linear function approximation.
  Using the optimism principle and assuming that the MDP has a linear structure, we
  first propose a computationally inefficient algorithm with optimal O(\\sqrt{T})
  regret and another computationally efficient variant with O(T^{3/4}) regret, where
  T is the number of interactions. Next, taking inspiration from adversarial linear
  bandits, we develop yet another efficient algorithm with O(\\sqrt{T}) regret under
  a different set of assumptions, improving the best existing result by Hao et al.
  (2020) with O(T^{2/3}) regret. Moreover, we draw a connection between this algorithm
  and the Natural Policy Gradient algorithm proposed by Kakade (2002), and show that
  our analysis improves the sample complexity bound recently given by Agarwal et al.
  (2020). "
