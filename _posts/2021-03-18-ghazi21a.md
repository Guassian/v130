title: " Robust and Private Learning of Halfspaces "
abstract: " In this work, we study the trade-off between differential privacy and
  adversarial robustness under $L_2$-perturbations in the context of learning halfspaces.
  We prove nearly tight bounds on the sample complexity of robust private learning
  of halfspaces for a large regime of parameters. A highlight of our results is that
  robust and private learning is harder than robust or private learning alone. We
  complement our theoretical analysis with experimental results on the MNIST and USPS
  datasets, for a learning algorithm that is both differentially private and adversarially
  robust. "
