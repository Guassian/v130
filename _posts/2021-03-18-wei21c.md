title: " Sample Elicitation "
abstract: " It is important to collect credible training samples $(x,y)$ for building
  data-intensive learning systems (e.g., a deep learning system). Asking people to
  report complex distribution $p(x)$, though theoretically viable, is challenging
  in practice. This is primarily due to the cognitive loads required for human agents
  to form the report of this highly complicated information. While classical elicitation
  mechanisms apply to eliciting a complex and generative (and continuous) distribution
  $p(x)$, we are interested in eliciting samples $x_i \\sim p(x)$ from agents directly.
  We coin the above problem sample elicitation. This paper introduces a deep learning
  aided method to incentivize credible sample contributions from self-interested and
  rational agents. We show that with an accurate estimation of a certain $f$-divergence
  function we can achieve approximate incentive compatibility in eliciting truthful
  samples. We then present an efficient estimator with theoretical guarantees via
  studying the variational forms of the $f$-divergence function. We also show a connection
  between this sample elicitation problem and $f$-GAN, and how this connection can
  help reconstruct an estimator of the distribution based on collected samples. Experiments
  on synthetic data, MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that our mechanism elicits
  truthful samples. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/weijiaheng/Credible-sample-elicitation.git. "
