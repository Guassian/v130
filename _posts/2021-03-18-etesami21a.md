title: " A Variational Inference Approach to Learning Multivariate Wold Processes "
abstract: " Temporal point-processes are often used for mathematical modeling of sequences
  of discrete events with asynchronous timestamps. We focus on a class of temporal
  point-process models called multivariate Wold processes (MWP). These processes are
  well suited to model real-world communication dynamics. Statistical inference on
  such processes often requires learning their corresponding parameters using a set
  of observed timestamps. In this work, we relax some of the restrictive modeling
  assumptions made in the state-of-the-art and introduce a Bayesian approach for inferring
  the parameters of MWP. We develop a computationally efficient variational inference
  algorithm that allows scaling up the approach to high-dimensional processes and
  long sequences of observations. Our experimental results on both synthetic and real-world
  datasets show that our proposed algorithm outperforms existing methods. "
