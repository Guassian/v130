title: " An Adaptive-MCMC Scheme for Setting Trajectory Lengths in Hamiltonian Monte
  Carlo "
abstract: " Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a powerful MCMC algorithm based on simulating
  Hamiltonian dynamics. Its performance depends strongly on choosing appropriate values
  for two parameters: the step size used in the simulation, and how long the simulation
  runs for. The step-size parameter can be tuned using standard adaptive-MCMC strategies,
  but it is less obvious how to tune the simulation-length parameter. The no-U-turn
  sampler (NUTS) eliminates this problematic simulation-length parameter, but NUTS’s
  relatively complex control flow makes it difficult to efficiently run many parallel
  chains on accelerators such as GPUs. NUTS also spends some extra gradient evaluations
  relative to HMC in order to decide how long to run each iteration without violating
  detailed balance. We propose ChEES-HMC, a simple adaptive-MCMC scheme for automatically
  tuning HMC’s simulation-length parameter, which minimizes a proxy for the autocorrelation
  of the state’s second moments. We evaluate ChEES-HMC and NUTS on many tasks, and
  find that ChEES-HMC typically yields larger effective sample sizes per gradient
  evaluation than NUTS does. When running many chains on a GPU, ChEES-HMC can also
  run significantly more gradient evaluations per second than NUTS, allowing it to
  quickly provide accurate estimates of posterior expectations. "
