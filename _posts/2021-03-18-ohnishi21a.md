title: " Novel Change of Measure Inequalities with Applications to PAC-Bayesian Bounds
  \ and Monte Carlo Estimation "
abstract: " We introduce several novel change of measure inequalities for two families
  of divergences: $f$-divergences and $\\alpha$-divergences. We show how the variational
  representation for $f$-divergences leads to novel change of measure inequalities.
  We also present a multiplicative change of measure inequality for $\\alpha$-divergences
  and a generalized version of Hammersley-Chapman-Robbins inequality. Finally, we
  present several applications of our change of measure inequalities, including PAC-Bayesian
  bounds for various classes of losses and non-asymptotic intervals for Monte Carlo
  estimates. "
