title: " Causal Inference under Networked Interference and Intervention Policy Enhancement "
abstract: " Estimating individual treatment effects from data of randomized experiments
  is a critical task in causal inference. The Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption
  (SUTVA) is usually made in causal inference. However, interference can introduce
  bias when the assigned treatment on one unit affects the potential outcomes of the
  neighboring units. This interference phenomenon is known as spillover effect in
  economics or peer effect in social science. Usually, in randomized experiments or
  observational studies with interconnected units, one can only observe treatment
  responses under interference. Hence, the issue of how to estimate the superimposed
  causal effect and recover the individual treatment effect in the presence of interference
  becomes a challenging task in causal inference. In this work, we study causal effect
  estimation under general network interference using Graph Neural Networks, which
  are powerful tools for capturing node and link dependencies in graphs. After deriving
  causal effect estimators, we further study intervention policy improvement on the
  graph under capacity constraint. We give policy regret bounds under network interference
  and treatment capacity constraint. Furthermore, a heuristic graph structure-dependent
  error bound for Graph Neural Network-based causal estimators is provided. "
