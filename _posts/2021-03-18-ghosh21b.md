title: " Variational inference for nonlinear ordinary differential equations "
abstract: " We apply the reparameterisation trick to obtain a variational formulation
  of Bayesian inference in nonlinear ODE models. By invoking the linear noise approximation
  we also extend this variational formulation to a stochastic kinetic model. Our proposed
  inference method does not depend on any emulation of the ODE solution and only requires
  the extension of automatic differentiation to an ODE. We achieve this through a
  novel and holistic approach that uses both forward and adjoint sensitivity analysis
  techniques. Consequently, this approach can cater to both small and large ODE models
  efficiently. Upon benchmarking on some widely used mechanistic models, the proposed
  inference method produced a reliable approximation to the posterior distribution,
  with a significant reduction in execution time, in comparison to MCMC. "
