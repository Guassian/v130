title: " Sparse Algorithms for Markovian Gaussian Processes "
abstract: " Approximate Bayesian inference methods that scale to very large datasets
  are crucial in leveraging probabilistic models for real-world time series. Sparse
  Markovian Gaussian processes combine the use of inducing variables with efficient
  Kalman filter-like recursions, resulting in algorithms whose computational and memory
  requirements scale linearly in the number of inducing points, whilst also enabling
  parallel parameter updates and stochastic optimisation. Under this paradigm, we
  derive a general site-based approach to approximate inference, whereby we approximate
  the non-Gaussian likelihood with local Gaussian terms, called sites. Our approach
  results in a suite of novel sparse extensions to algorithms from both the machine
  learning and signal processing literature, including variational inference, expectation
  propagation, and the classical nonlinear Kalman smoothers. The derived methods are
  suited to large time series, and we also demonstrate their applicability to spatio-temporal
  data, where the model has separate inducing points in both time and space. "
