title: " Causal Autoregressive Flows "
abstract: " Two apparently unrelated fields — normalizing flows and causality — have
  recently received considerable attention in the machine learning community. In this
  work, we highlight an intrinsic correspondence between a simple family of autoregressive
  normalizing flows and identifiable causal models. We exploit the fact that autoregressive
  flow architectures define an ordering over variables, analogous to a causal ordering,
  to show that they are well-suited to performing a range of causal inference tasks,
  ranging from causal discovery to making interventional and counterfactual predictions.
  First, we show that causal models derived from both affine and additive autoregressive
  flows with fixed orderings over variables are identifiable, i.e. the true direction
  of causal influence can be recovered. This provides a generalization of the additive
  noise model well-known in causal discovery. Second, we derive a bivariate measure
  of causal direction based on likelihood ratios, leveraging the fact that flow models
  can estimate normalized log-densities of data. Third, we demonstrate that flows
  naturally allow for direct evaluation of both interventional and counterfactual
  queries, the latter case being possible due to the invertible nature of flows. Finally,
  throughout a series of experiments on synthetic and real data, the proposed method
  is shown to outperform current approaches for causal discovery as well as making
  accurate interventional and counterfactual predictions. "
