title: " Dynamic Cutset Networks "
abstract: " Tractable probabilistic models (TPMs) are appealing because they admit
  polynomial-time inference for a wide variety of queries. In this work, we extend
  the cutset network (CN) framework, a powerful sub-class of TPMs that often outperforms
  probabilistic graphical models in terms of prediction accuracy, to the temporal
  domain. This extension, dubbed dynamic cutset networks (DCNs), uses a CN to model
  the prior distribution and a conditional CN to model the transition distribution.
  We show that although exact inference is intractable when arbitrary conditional
  CNs are used, particle filtering is efficient. To ensure tractability of exact inference,
  we introduce a novel constrained conditional model called AND/OR conditional cutset
  networks and show that under certain conditions exact inference is linear in the
  size of the corresponding constrained DCN. Experiments on several sequential datasets
  demonstrate the efficacy of our framework. "
