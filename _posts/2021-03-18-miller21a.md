title: " Tensor Networks for Probabilistic Sequence Modeling "
abstract: " Tensor networks are a powerful modeling framework developed for computational
  many-body physics, which have only recently been applied within machine learning.
  In this work we utilize a uniform matrix product state (u-MPS) model for probabilistic
  modeling of sequence data. We first show that u-MPS enable sequence-level parallelism,
  with length-n sequences able to be evaluated in depth O(log n). We then introduce
  a novel generative algorithm giving trained u-MPS the ability to efficiently sample
  from a wide variety of conditional distributions, each one defined by a regular
  expression. Special cases of this algorithm correspond to autoregressive and fill-in-the-blank
  sampling, but more complex regular expressions permit the generation of richly structured
  data in a manner that has no direct analogue in neural generative models. Experiments
  on sequence modeling with synthetic and real text data show u-MPS outperforming
  a variety of baselines and effectively generalizing their predictions in the presence
  of limited data. "
