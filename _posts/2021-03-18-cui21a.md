title: " Approximately Solving Mean Field Games via Entropy-Regularized Deep Reinforcement
  Learning "
abstract: " The recent mean field game (MFG) formalism facilitates otherwise intractable
  computation of approximate Nash equilibria in many-agent settings. In this paper,
  we consider discrete-time finite MFGs subject to finite-horizon objectives. We show
  that all discrete-time finite MFGs with non-constant fixed point operators fail
  to be contractive as typically assumed in existing MFG literature, barring convergence
  via fixed point iteration. Instead, we incorporate entropy-regularization and Boltzmann
  policies into the fixed point iteration. As a result, we obtain provable convergence
  to approximate fixed points where existing methods fail, and reach the original
  goal of approximate Nash equilibria. All proposed methods are evaluated with respect
  to their exploitability, on both instructive examples with tractable exact solutions
  and high-dimensional problems where exact methods become intractable. In high-dimensional
  scenarios, we apply established deep reinforcement learning methods and empirically
  combine fictitious play with our approximations. "
