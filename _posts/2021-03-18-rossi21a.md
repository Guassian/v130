title: " Sparse Gaussian Processes Revisited: Bayesian Approaches to Inducing-Variable
  Approximations "
abstract: " Variational inference techniques based on inducing variables provide an
  elegant framework for scalable posterior estimation in Gaussian process (GP) models.
  Besides enabling scalability, one of their main advantages over sparse approximations
  using direct marginal likelihood maximization is that they provide a robust alternative
  for point estimation of the inducing inputs, i.e. the location of the inducing variables.
  In this work we challenge the common wisdom that optimizing the inducing inputs
  in the variational framework yields optimal performance. We show that, by revisiting
  old model approximations such as the fully-independent training conditionals endowed
  with powerful sampling-based inference methods, treating both inducing locations
  and GP hyper-parameters in a Bayesian way can improve performance significantly.
  Based on stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, we develop a fully Bayesian
  approach to scalable GP and deep GP models, and demonstrate its state-of-the-art
  performance through an extensive experimental campaign across several regression
  and classification problems. "
