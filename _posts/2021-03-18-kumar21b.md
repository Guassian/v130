title: " Context-Specific Likelihood Weighting "
abstract: " Sampling is a popular method for approximate inference when exact inference
  is impractical. Generally, sampling algorithms do not exploit context-specific independence
  (CSI) properties of probability distributions. We introduce context-specific likelihood
  weighting (CS-LW), a new sampling methodology, which besides exploiting the classical
  conditional independence properties, also exploits CSI properties. Unlike the standard
  likelihood weighting, CS-LW is based on partial assignments of random variables
  and requires fewer samples for convergence due to the sampling variance reduction.
  Furthermore, the speed of generating samples increases. Our novel notion of contextual
  assignments theoretically justifies CS-LW. We empirically show that CS-LW is competitive
  with state-of-the-art algorithms for approximate inference in the presence of a
  significant amount of CSIs. "
