title: " Optimal query complexity for private sequential learning against eavesdropping "
abstract: " We study the query complexity of a learner-private sequential learning
  problem, motivated by the privacy and security concerns due to eavesdropping that
  arise in practical applications such as pricing and Federated Learning. A learner
  tries to estimate an unknown scalar value, by sequentially querying an external
  database and receiving binary responses; meanwhile, a third-party adversary observes
  the learner’s queries but not the responses. The learner’s goal is to design a querying
  strategy with the minimum number of queries (optimal query complexity) so that she
  can accurately estimate the true value, while the eavesdropping adversary even with
  the complete knowledge of her querying strategy cannot. "
