title: " Accumulations of Projections—A Unified Framework for Random Sketches in Kernel
  Ridge Regression "
abstract: " Building a sketch of an n-by-n empirical kernel matrix is a common approach
  to accelerate the computation of many kernel methods. In this paper, we propose
  a unified framework of constructing sketching methods in kernel ridge regression
  (KRR), which views the sketching matrix S as an accumulation of m rescaled sub-sampling
  matrices with independent columns. Our framework incorporates two commonly used
  sketching methods, sub-sampling sketches (known as the Nyström method) and sub-Gaussian
  sketches, as special cases with m=1 and m=infinity respectively. Under the new framework,
  we provide a unified error analysis of sketching approximation and show that our
  accumulation scheme improves the low accuracy of sub-sampling sketches when certain
  incoherence characteristic is high, and accelerates the more accurate but computationally
  heavier sub-Gaussian sketches. By optimally choosing the number m of accumulations,
  we show that a best trade-off between computational efficiency and statistical accuracy
  can be achieved. In practice, the sketching method can be as efficiently implemented
  as the sub-sampling sketches, as only minor extra matrix additions are needed. Our
  empirical evaluations also demonstrate that the proposed method may attain the accuracy
  close to sub-Gaussian sketches, while is as efficient as sub-sampling-based sketches. "
