title: " Diagnostic Uncertainty Calibration: Towards Reliable Machine Predictions
  in Medical Domain "
abstract: " We propose an evaluation framework for class probability estimates (CPEs)
  in the presence of label uncertainty, which is commonly observed as diagnosis disagreement
  between experts in the medical domain. We also formalize evaluation metrics for
  higher-order statistics, including inter-rater disagreement, to assess predictions
  on label uncertainty. Moreover, we propose a novel post-hoc method called alpha-calibration,
  that equips neural network classifiers with calibrated distributions over CPEs.
  Using synthetic experiments and a large-scale medical imaging application, we show
  that our approach significantly enhances the reliability of uncertainty estimates:
  disagreement probabilities and posterior CPEs. "
