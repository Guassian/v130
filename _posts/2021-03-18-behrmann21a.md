title: " Understanding and Mitigating Exploding Inverses in Invertible Neural Networks "
abstract: " Invertible neural networks (INNs) have been used to design generative
  models, implement memory-saving gradient computation, and solve inverse problems.
  In this work, we show that commonly-used INN architectures suffer from exploding
  inverses and are thus prone to becoming numerically non-invertible. Across a wide
  range of INN use-cases, we reveal failures including the non-applicability of the
  change-of-variables formula on in- and out-of-distribution (OOD) data, incorrect
  gradients for memory-saving backprop, and the inability to sample from normalizing
  flow models. We further derive bi-Lipschitz properties of atomic building blocks
  of common architectures. These insights into the stability of INNs then provide
  ways forward to remedy these failures. For tasks where local invertibility is sufficient,
  like memory-saving backprop, we propose a flexible and efficient regularizer. For
  problems where global invertibility is necessary, such as applying normalizing flows
  on OOD data, we show the importance of designing stable INN building blocks. "
