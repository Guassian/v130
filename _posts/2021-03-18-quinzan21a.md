title: " Adaptive Sampling for Fast Constrained Maximization of Submodular Functions "
abstract: " Several large-scale machine learning tasks, such as data summarization,
  can be approached by maximizing functions that satisfy submodularity. These optimization
  problems often involve complex side constraints, imposed by the underlying application.
  In this paper, we develop an algorithm with poly-logarithmic adaptivity for non-monotone
  submodular maximization under general side constraints. The adaptive complexity
  of a problem is the minimal number of sequential rounds required to achieve the
  objective. Our algorithm is suitable to maximize a non-monotone submodular function
  under a p-system side constraint, and it achieves a (p + O(sqrt(p)))-approximation
  for this problem, after only poly-logarithmic adaptive rounds and polynomial queries
  to the valuation oracle function. Furthermore, our algorithm achieves a (p + O(1))-approximation
  when the given side constraint is a p-extendable system. This algorithm yields an
  exponential speed-up, with respect to the adaptivity, over any other known constant-factor
  approximation algorithm for this problem. It also competes with previous known results
  in terms of the query complexity. We perform various experiments on various real-world
  applications. We find that, in comparison with commonly used heuristics, our algorithm
  performs better on these instances. "
