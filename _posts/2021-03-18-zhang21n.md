title: " On the Importance of Hyperparameter Optimization for Model-based Reinforcement
  Learning "
abstract: " Model-based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) is a promising framework for
  learning control in a data-efficient manner. MBRL algorithms can be fairly complex
  due to the separate dynamics modeling and the subsequent planning algorithm, and
  as a result, they often possess tens of hyperparameters and architectural choices.
  For this reason, MBRL typically requires significant human expertise before it can
  be applied to new problems and domains. To alleviate this problem, we propose to
  use automatic hyperparameter optimization (HPO). We demonstrate that this problem
  can be tackled effectively with automated HPO, which we demonstrate to yield significantly
  improved performance compared to human experts. In addition, we show that tuning
  of several MBRL hyperparameters dynamically, i.e. during the training itself, further
  improves the performance compared to using static hyperparameters which are kept
  fix for the whole training. Finally, our experiments provide valuable insights into
  the effects of several hyperparameters, such as plan horizon or learning rate and
  their influence on the stability of training and resulting rewards. "
