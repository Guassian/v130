title: " Adaptive wavelet pooling for convolutional neural networks "
abstract: " Convolutional neural networks (CNN)s have become the go-to choice for
  most image and video processing tasks. Most CNN architectures rely on pooling layers
  to reduce the resolution along spatial dimensions. The reduction allows subsequent
  deep convolution layers to operate with greater efficiency. This paper introduces
  adaptive wavelet pooling layers, which employ fast wavelet transforms (FWT) to reduce
  the feature resolution. The FWT decomposes the input features into multiple scales
  reducing the feature dimensions by removing the fine-scale subbands. Our approach
  adds extra flexibility through wavelet-basis function optimization and coefficient
  weighting at different scales. The adaptive wavelet layers integrate directly into
  well-known CNNs like the LeNet, Alexnet, or Densenet architectures. Using these
  networks, we validate our approach and find competitive performance on the MNIST,
  CIFAR10, and SVHN (street view house numbers) data-sets. "
