title: " Faster & More Reliable Tuning of Neural Networks: Bayesian Optimization with
  Importance Sampling "
abstract: " Many contemporary machine learning models require extensive tuning of
  hyperparameters to perform well. A variety of methods, such as Bayesian optimization,
  have been developed to automate and expedite this process. However, tuning remains
  extremely costly as it typically requires repeatedly fully training models. To address
  this issue, Bayesian optimization methods have been extended to use cheap, partially
  trained models to extrapolate to expensive complete models. While this approach
  enlarges the set of explored hyperparameters, including many low-fidelity observations
  adds to the intrinsic randomness of the procedure and makes extrapolation challenging.
  We propose to accelerate hyperparameter tuning for neural networks in a robust way
  by taking into account the relative amount of information contributed by each training
  example. To do so, we integrate importance sampling with Bayesian optimization,
  which significantly increases the quality of the black-box function evaluations
  and their runtime. To overcome the additional overhead cost of using importance
  sampling, we cast hyperparameter search as a multi-task Bayesian optimization problem
  over both hyperparameters and importance sampling design, which achieves the best
  of both worlds. Through learning a trade-off between training complexity and quality,
  our method improves upon validation error, in the average and worst-case. We show
  that this results in more reliable performance of our method in less wall-clock
  time across a variety of and datasets complex neural architectures. "
