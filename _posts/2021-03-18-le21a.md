title: " Entropy Partial Transport with Tree Metrics: Theory and Practice "
abstract: " Optimal transport (OT) theory provides powerful tools to compare probability
  measures. However, OT is limited to nonnegative measures having the same mass, and
  suffers serious drawbacks about its computation and statistics. This leads to several
  proposals of regularized variants of OT in the recent literature. In this work,
  we consider an entropy partial transport (EPT) problem for nonnegative measures
  on a tree having different masses. The EPT is shown to be equivalent to a standard
  complete OT problem on a one-node extended tree. We derive its dual formulation,
  then leverage this to propose a novel regularization for EPT which admits fast computation
  and negative definiteness. To our knowledge, the proposed regularized EPT is the
  first approach that yields a closed-form solution among available variants of unbalanced
  OT for general nonnegative measures. For practical applications without prior knowledge
  about the tree structure for measures, we propose tree-sliced variants of the regularized
  EPT, computed by averaging the regularized EPT between these measures using random
  tree metrics, built adaptively from support data points. Exploiting the negative
  definiteness of our regularized EPT, we introduce a positive definite kernel, and
  evaluate it against other baselines on benchmark tasks such as document classification
  with word embedding and topological data analysis. In addition, we empirically demonstrate
  that our regularization also provides effective approximations. "
