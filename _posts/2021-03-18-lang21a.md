title: " Beyond Perturbation Stability: LP Recovery Guarantees for MAP Inference on
  Noisy Stable Instances "
abstract: ' Several works have shown that perturbation stable instances of the MAP
  inference problem can be solved exactly using a natural linear programming (LP)
  relaxation. However, most of these works give few (or no) guarantees for the LP
  solutions on instances that do not satisfy the relatively strict perturbation stability
  definitions. In this work, we go beyond these stability results by showing that
  the LP approximately recovers the MAP solution of a stable instance even after the
  instance is corrupted by noise. This "noisy stable" model realistically fits with
  practical MAP inference problems: we design an algorithm for finding "close" stable
  instances, and show that several real-world instances from computer vision have
  nearby instances that are perturbation stable. These results suggest a new theoretical
  explanation for the excellent performance of this LP relaxation in practice. '
