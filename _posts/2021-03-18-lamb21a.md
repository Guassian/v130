title: " Neural Function Modules with Sparse Arguments: A Dynamic Approach to Integrating
  Information across Layers "
abstract: " Feed-forward neural networks consist of a sequence of layers, in which
  each layer performs some processing on the information from the previous layer.
  A downside to this approach is that each layer (or module, as multiple modules can
  operate in parallel) is tasked with processing the entire hidden state, rather than
  a particular part of the state which is most relevant for that module. Methods which
  only operate on a small number of input variables are an essential part of most
  programming languages, and they allow for improved modularity and code re-usability.
  Our proposed method, Neural Function Modules (NFM), aims to introduce the same structural
  capability into deep learning. Most of the work in the context of feed-forward networks
  combining top-down and bottom-up feedback is limited to classification problems.
  The key contribution of our work is to combine attention, sparsity, top-down and
  bottom-up feedback, in a flexible algorithm which, as we show, improves the results
  in standard classification, out-of-domain generalization, generative modeling, and
  learning representations in the context of reinforcement learning. "
