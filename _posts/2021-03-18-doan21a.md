title: " A Theoretical Analysis of Catastrophic Forgetting through the NTK Overlap
  Matrix "
abstract: " Continual learning (CL) is a setting in which an agent has to learn from
  an incoming stream of data during its entire lifetime. Although major advances have
  been made in the field, one recurring problem which remains unsolved is that of
  Catastrophic Forgetting (CF). While the issue has been extensively studied empirically,
  little attention has been paid from a theoretical angle. In this paper, we show
  that the impact of CF increases as two tasks increasingly align. We introduce a
  measure of task similarity called the NTK overlap matrix which is at the core of
  CF. We analyze common projected gradient algorithms and demonstrate how they mitigate
  forgetting. Then, we propose a variant of Orthogonal Gradient Descent (OGD) which
  leverages structure of the data through Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Experiments
  support our theoretical findings and show how our method can help reduce CF on classical
  CL datasets. "
