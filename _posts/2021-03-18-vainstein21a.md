title: " Hierarchical Clustering via Sketches and Hierarchical Correlation Clustering "
abstract: " Recently, Hierarchical Clustering (HC) has been considered through the
  lens of optimization. In particular, two maximization objectives have been defined.
  Moseley and Wang defined the \\emph{Revenue} objective to handle similarity information
  given by a weighted graph on the data points (w.l.o.g., $[0,1]$ weights), while
  Cohen-Addad et al. defined the \\emph{Dissimilarity} objective to handle dissimilarity
  information. In this paper, we prove structural lemmas for both objectives allowing
  us to convert any HC tree to a tree with constant number of internal nodes while
  incurring an arbitrarily small loss in each objective. Although the best-known approximations
  are 0.585 and 0.667 respectively, using our lemmas we obtain approximations arbitrarily
  close to 1, if not all weights are small (i.e., there exist constants $\\epsilon,
  \\delta$ such that the fraction of weights smaller than $\\delta$, is at most $1
  - \\epsilon$); such instances encompass many metric-based similarity instances,
  thereby improving upon prior work. Finally, we introduce Hierarchical Correlation
  Clustering (HCC) to handle instances that contain similarity and dissimilarity information
  simultaneously. For HCC, we provide an approximation of 0.4767 and for complementary
  similarity/dissimilarity weights (analogous to $+/-$ correlation clustering), we
  again present nearly-optimal approximations. "
