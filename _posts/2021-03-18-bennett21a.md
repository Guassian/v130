title: " Off-policy Evaluation in Infinite-Horizon Reinforcement Learning with Latent
  Confounders "
abstract: " Off-policy evaluation (OPE) in reinforcement learning is an important
  problem in settings where experimentation is limited, such as healthcare. But, in
  these very same settings, observed actions are often confounded by unobserved variables
  making OPE even more difficult. We study an OPE problem in an infinite-horizon,
  ergodic Markov decision process with unobserved confounders, where states and actions
  can act as proxies for the unobserved confounders. We show how, given only a latent
  variable model for states and actions, policy value can be identified from off-policy
  data. Our method involves two stages. In the first, we show how to use proxies to
  estimate stationary distribution ratios, extending recent work on breaking the curse
  of horizon to the confounded setting. In the second, we show optimal balancing can
  be combined with such learned ratios to obtain policy value while avoiding direct
  modeling of reward functions. We establish theoretical guarantees of consistency
  and benchmark our method empirically. "
