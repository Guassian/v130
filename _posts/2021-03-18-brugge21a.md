title: " On the convergence of the Metropolis algorithm with fixed-order updates for
  multivariate binary probability distributions "
abstract: " The Metropolis algorithm is arguably the most fundamental Markov chain
  Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. But the algorithm is not guaranteed to converge to the
  desired distribution in the case of multivariate binary distributions (e.g., Ising
  models or stochastic neural networks such as Boltzmann machines) if the variables
  (sites or neurons) are updated in a fixed order, a setting commonly used in practice.
  The reason is that the corresponding Markov chain may not be irreducible. We propose
  a modified Metropolis transition operator that behaves almost always identically
  to the standard Metropolis operator and prove that it ensures irreducibility and
  convergence to the limiting distribution in the multivariate binary case with fixed-order
  updates. The result provides an explanation for the behaviour of Metropolis MCMC
  in that setting and closes a long-standing theoretical gap. We experimentally studied
  the standard and modified Metropolis operator for models where they actually behave
  differently. If the standard algorithm also converges, the modified operator exhibits
  similar (if not better) performance in terms of convergence speed. "
