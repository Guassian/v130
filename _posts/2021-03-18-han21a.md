title: " Simultaneously Reconciled Quantile Forecasting of Hierarchically Related
  Time Series "
abstract: " Many real-life applications involve simultaneously forecasting multiple
  time series that are hierarchically related via aggregation or disaggregation operations.
  For instance, commercial organizations often want to forecast inventories simultaneously
  at store, city, and state levels for resource planning purposes. In such applications,
  it is important that the forecasts, in addition to being reasonably accurate, are
  also consistent w.r.t one another. Although forecasting such hierarchical time series
  has been pursued by economists and data scientists, the current state-of-the-art
  models use strong assumptions, e.g., all forecasts being unbiased estimates, noise
  distribution being Gaussian. Besides, state-of-the-art models have not harnessed
  the power of modern nonlinear models, especially ones based on deep learning. In
  this paper, we propose using a flexible nonlinear model that optimizes quantile
  regression loss coupled with suitable regularization terms to maintain the consistency
  of forecasts across hierarchies. The theoretical framework introduced herein can
  be applied to any forecasting model with an underlying differentiable loss function.
  A proof of optimality of our proposed method is also provided. Simulation studies
  over a range of datasets highlight the efficacy of our approach. "
