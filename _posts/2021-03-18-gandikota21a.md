title: " vqSGD: Vector Quantized Stochastic Gradient Descent "
abstract: " In this work, we present a family of vector quantization schemes vqSGD
  (Vector-Quantized Stochastic Gradient Descent) that provide an asymptotic reduction
  in the communication cost with convergence guarantees in first-order distributed
  optimization. In the process we derive the following fundamental information theoretic
  fact: $\\Theta(\\frac{d}{R^2})$ bits are necessary and sufficient (up to an additive
  $O(\\log d)$ term) to describe an unbiased estimator $\\hat{g}(g)$ for any $g$ in
  the $d$-dimensional unit sphere, under the constraint that $\\|\\hat{g}(g)\\|_2\\le
  R$ almost surely. In particular, we consider a randomized scheme based on the convex
  hull of a point set, that returns an unbiased estimator of a $d$-dimensional gradient
  vector with almost surely bounded norm. We provide multiple efficient instances
  of our scheme, that are near optimal, and require only $o(d)$ bits of communication
  at the expense of tolerable increase in error. The instances of our quantization
  scheme are obtained using the properties of binary error-correcting codes and provide
  a smooth tradeoff between the communication and the estimation error of quantization.
  Furthermore, we show that vqSGD also offers some automatic privacy guarantees. "
