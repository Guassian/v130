title: " When Will Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning Algorithms Attain Global
  Convergence "
abstract: " Generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) is a popular inverse
  reinforcement learning approach for jointly optimizing policy and reward from expert
  trajectories. A primary question about GAIL is whether applying a certain policy
  gradient algorithm to GAIL attains a global minimizer (i.e., yields the expert policy),
  for which existing understanding is very limited. Such global convergence has been
  shown only for the linear (or linear-type) MDP and linear (or linearizable) reward.
  In this paper, we study GAIL under general MDP and for nonlinear reward function
  classes (as long as the objective function is strongly concave with respect to the
  reward parameter). We characterize the global convergence with a sublinear rate
  for a broad range of commonly used policy gradient algorithms, all of which are
  implemented in an alternating manner with stochastic gradient ascent for reward
  update, including projected policy gradient (PPG)-GAIL, Frank-Wolfe policy gradient
  (FWPG)-GAIL, trust region policy optimization (TRPO)-GAIL and natural policy gradient
  (NPG)-GAIL. This is the first systematic theoretical study of GAIL for global convergence. "
