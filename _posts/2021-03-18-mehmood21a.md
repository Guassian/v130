title: " Differentiating the Value Function by using Convex Duality "
abstract: " We consider the differentiation of the value function for parametric optimization
  problems. Such problems are ubiquitous in machine learning applications such as
  structured support vector machines, matrix factorization and min-min or minimax
  problems in general. Existing approaches for computing the derivative rely on strong
  assumptions of the parametric function. Therefore, in several scenarios there is
  no theoretical evidence that a given algorithmic differentiation strategy computes
  the true gradient information of the value function. We leverage a well known result
  from convex duality theory to relax the conditions and to derive convergence rates
  of the derivative approximation for several classes of parametric optimization problems
  in Machine Learning. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach in several experiments,
  including non-smooth parametric functions. Even in settings where other approaches
  are applicable, our duality based strategy shows a favorable performance. "
