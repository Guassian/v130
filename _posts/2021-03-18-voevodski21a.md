title: " Large Scale K-Median Clustering for Stable Clustering Instances "
abstract: " We study the problem of computing a good k-median clustering in a parallel
  computing environment. We design an efficient algorithm that gives a constant-factor
  approximation to the optimal solution for stable clustering instances. The notion
  of stability that we consider is resilience to perturbations of the distances between
  the points. Our computational experiments show that our algorithm works well in
  practice - we are able to find better clusterings than Lloydâ€™s algorithm and a centralized
  coreset construction using samples of the same size. "
