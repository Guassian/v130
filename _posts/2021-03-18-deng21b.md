title: " Improving Adversarial Robustness via Unlabeled Out-of-Domain Data "
abstract: " Data augmentation by incorporating cheap unlabeled data from multiple
  domains is a powerful way to improve prediction especially when there is limited
  labeled data. In this work, we investigate how adversarial robustness can be enhanced
  by leveraging out-of-domain unlabeled data. We demonstrate that for broad classes
  of distributions and classifiers, there exists a sample complexity gap between standard
  and robust classification. We quantify the extent to which this gap can be bridged
  by leveraging unlabeled samples from a shifted domain by providing both upper and
  lower bounds. Moreover, we show settings where we achieve better adversarial robustness
  when the unlabeled data come from a shifted domain rather than the same domain as
  the labeled data. We also investigate how to leverage out-of-domain data when some
  structural information, such as sparsity, is shared between labeled and unlabeled
  domains. Experimentally, we augment object recognition datasets (CIFAR-10, CINIC-10,
  and SVHN) with easy-to-obtain and unlabeled out-of-domain data and demonstrate substantial
  improvement in the modelâ€™s robustness against $\\ell_\\infty$ adversarial attacks
  on the original domain. "
