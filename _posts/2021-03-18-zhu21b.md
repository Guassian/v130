title: " Deep Fourier Kernel for Self-Attentive Point Processes "
abstract: " We present a novel attention-based model for discrete event data to capture
  complex non-linear temporal dependence structures. We borrow the idea from the attention
  mechanism and incorporate it into the point processes’ conditional intensity function.
  We further introduce a novel score function using Fourier kernel embedding, whose
  spectrum is represented using neural networks, which drastically differs from the
  traditional dot-product kernel and can capture a more complex similarity structure.
  We establish our approach’s theoretical properties and demonstrate our approach’s
  competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art for synthetic and real
  data. "
