title: " ATOL: Measure Vectorization for Automatic Topologically-Oriented Learning "
abstract: " Robust topological information commonly comes in the form of a set of
  persistence diagrams, finite measures that are in nature uneasy to affix to generic
  machine learning frameworks. We introduce a fast, learnt, unsupervised vectorization
  method for measures in Euclidean spaces and use it for reflecting underlying changes
  in topological behaviour in machine learning contexts. The algorithm is simple and
  efficiently discriminates important space regions where meaningful differences to
  the mean measure arise. It is proven to be able to separate clusters of persistence
  diagrams. We showcase the strength and robustness of our approach on a number of
  applications, from emulous and modern graph collections where the method reaches
  state-of-the-art performance to a geometric synthetic dynamical orbits problem.
  The proposed methodology comes with a single high level tuning parameter: the total
  measure encoding budget. We provide a completely open access software. "
