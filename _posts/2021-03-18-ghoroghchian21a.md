title: " Graph Community Detection from Coarse Measurements: Recovery Conditions for
  the Coarsened Weighted Stochastic Block Model "
abstract: " We study the problem of community recovery from coarse measurements of
  a graph. In contrast to the problem of community recovery of a fully observed graph,
  one often encounters situations when measurements of a graph are made at low-resolution,
  each measurement integrating across multiple graph nodes. Such low-resolution measurements
  effectively induce a coarse graph with its own communities. Our objective is to
  develop conditions on the graph structure, the quantity, and properties of measurements,
  under which we can recover the community organization in this coarse graph. In this
  paper, we build on the stochastic block model by mathematically formalizing the
  coarsening process, and characterizing its impact on the community members and connections.
  Accordingly, we characterize an error bound for community recovery. The error bound
  yields simple and closed-form asymptotic conditions to achieve the perfect recovery
  of the coarse graph communities. "
