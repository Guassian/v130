title: " An Analysis of LIME for Text Data "
abstract: " Text data are increasingly handled in an automated fashion by machine
  learning algorithms. But the models handling these data are not always well-understood
  due to their complexity and are more and more often referred to as “black-boxes.”
  Interpretability methods aim to explain how these models operate. Among them, LIME
  has become one of the most popular in recent years. However, it comes without theoretical
  guarantees: even for simple models, we are not sure that LIME behaves accurately.
  In this paper, we provide a first theoretical analysis of LIME for text data. As
  a consequence of our theoretical findings, we show that LIME indeed provides meaningful
  explanations for simple models, namely decision trees and linear models. "
