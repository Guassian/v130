title: " Iterative regularization for convex regularizers "
abstract: " We study iterative regularization for linear models, when the bias is
  convex but not necessarily strongly convex. We characterize the stability properties
  of a primal-dual gradient based approach, analyzing its convergence in the presence
  of worst case deterministic noise. As a main example, we specialize and illustrate
  the results for the problem of robust sparse recovery. Key to our analysis is a
  combination of ideas from regularization theory and optimization in the presence
  of errors. Theoretical results are complemented by experiments showing that state-of-the-art
  performances are achieved with considerable computational speed-ups. "
