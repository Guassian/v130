title: " Logical Team Q-learning: An approach towards factored policies in cooperative
  MARL "
abstract: " We address the challenge of learning factored policies in cooperative
  MARL scenarios. In particular, we consider the situation in which a team of agents
  collaborates to optimize a common cost. The goal is to obtain factored policies
  that determine the individual behavior of each agent so that the resulting joint
  policy is optimal. The main contribution of this work is the introduction of Logical
  Team Q-learning (LTQL). LTQL does not rely on assumptions about the environment
  and hence is generally applicable to any collaborative MARL scenario. We derive
  LTQL as a stochastic approximation to a dynamic programming method we introduce
  in this work. We conclude the paper by providing experiments (both in the tabular
  and deep settings) that illustrate the claims. "
