title: " Why did the distribution change? "
abstract: ' We describe a formal approach based on graphical causal models to identify
  the "root causes" of the change in the probability distribution of variables. After
  factorizing the joint distribution into conditional distributions of each variable,
  given its parents (the "causal mechanisms"), we attribute the change to changes
  of these causal mechanisms. This attribution analysis accounts for the fact that
  mechanisms often change independently and sometimes only some of them change. Through
  simulations, we study the performance of our distribution change attribution proposal.
  We then present a real-world case study identifying the drivers of the difference
  in the income distribution between men and women. '
