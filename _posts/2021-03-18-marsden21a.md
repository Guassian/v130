title: " Misspecification in Prediction Problems and Robustness via Improper Learning "
abstract: " We study probabilistic prediction games when the underlying model is misspecified,
  investigating the consequences of predicting using an incorrect parametric model.
  We show that for a broad class of loss functions and parametric families of distributions,
  the regret of playing a “proper” predictor—one from the putative model class—relative
  to the best predictor in the same model class has lower bound scaling at least as
  $\\sqrt{\\gamma n}$, where $\\gamma$ is a measure of the model misspecification
  to the true distribution in terms of total variation distance. In contrast, using
  an aggregation-based (improper) learner, one can obtain regret $d \\log n$ for any
  underlying generating distribution, where $d$ is the dimension of the parameter;
  we exhibit instances in which this is unimprovable even over the family of all learners
  that may play distributions in the convex hull of the parametric family. These results
  suggest that simple strategies for aggregating multiple learners together should
  be more robust, and several experiments conform to this hypothesis. "
