title: " Explore the Context: Optimal Data Collection for Context-Conditional Dynamics
  Models "
abstract: " In this paper, we learn dynamics models for parametrized families of dynamical
  systems with varying properties. The dynamics models are formulated as stochastic
  processes conditioned on a latent context variable which is inferred from observed
  transitions of the respective system. The probabilistic formulation allows us to
  compute an action sequence which, for a limited number of environment interactions,
  optimally explores the given system within the parametrized family. This is achieved
  by steering the system through transitions being most informative for the context
  variable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for exploration on a non-linear
  toy-problem and two well-known reinforcement learning environments. "
