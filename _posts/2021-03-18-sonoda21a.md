title: " Ridge Regression with Over-parametrized Two-Layer Networks Converge to Ridgelet
  Spectrum "
abstract: " Characterization of local minima draws much attention in theoretical studies
  of deep learning. In this study, we investigate the distribution of parameters in
  an over-parametrized finite neural network trained by ridge regularized empirical
  square risk minimization (RERM). We develop a new theory of ridgelet transform,
  a wavelet-like integral transform that provides a powerful and general framework
  for the theoretical study of neural networks involving not only the ReLU but general
  activation functions. We show that the distribution of the parameters converges
  to a spectrum of the ridgelet transform. This result provides a new insight into
  the characterization of the local minima of neural networks, and the theoretical
  background of an inductive bias theory based on lazy regimes. We confirm the visual
  resemblance between the parameter distribution trained by SGD, and the ridgelet
  spectrum calculated by numerical integration through numerical experiments with
  finite models. "
