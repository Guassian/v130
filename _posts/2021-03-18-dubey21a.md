title: " No-Regret Algorithms for Private Gaussian Process Bandit Optimization "
abstract: " The widespread proliferation of data-driven decision-making has ushered
  in a recent interest in the design of privacy-preserving algorithms. In this paper,
  we consider the ubiquitous problem of gaussian process (GP) bandit optimization
  from the lens of privacy-preserving statistics. We propose a solution for differentially
  private GP bandit optimization that combines uniform kernel approximation with random
  perturbations, providing a generic framework to create differentially-private (DP)
  Gaussian process bandit algorithms. For two specific DP settings - joint and local
  differential privacy, we provide algorithms based on efficient quadrature Fourier
  feature approximators, that are computationally efficient and provably no-regret
  for a class of stationary kernel functions. In contrast to previous work, our algorithms
  maintain differential privacy throughout the optimization procedure and critically
  do not rely on the sample path for prediction, making them scalable and straightforward
  to release as well. "
