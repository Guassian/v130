title: " Cluster Trellis: Data Structures & Algorithms for Exact Inference in Hierarchical
  Clustering "
abstract: " Hierarchical clustering is a fundamental task often used to discover meaningful
  structures in data. Due to the combinatorial number of possible hierarchical clusterings,
  approximate algorithms are typically used for inference. In contrast to existing
  methods, we present novel dynamic-programming algorithms for exact inference in
  hierarchical clustering based on a novel trellis data structure, and we prove that
  we can exactly compute the partition function, maximum likelihood hierarchy, and
  marginal probabilities of sub-hierarchies and clusters. Our algorithms scale in
  time and space proportional to the powerset of N elements, which is super-exponentially
  more efficient than explicitly considering each of the (2N âˆ’ 3)!! possible hierarchies.
  Also, for larger datasets where our exact algorithms become infeasible, we introduce
  an approximate algorithm based on a sparse trellis that out- performs greedy and
  beam search baselines. "
