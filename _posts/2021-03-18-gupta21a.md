title: " Learning Temporal Point Processes with Intermittent Observations "
abstract: " Marked temporal point processes (MTPP) have emerged as a powerful framework
  to model the underlying generative mechanism of asynchronous events localized in
  continuous time. Most existing models and inference methods in MTPP framework consider
  only the complete observation scenario i.e. the event sequence being modeled is
  completely observed with no missing events â€“ an ideal setting barely encountered
  in practice. A recent line of work which considers missing events uses supervised
  learning techniques which require a missing or observed label for each event. In
  this work, we provide a novel unsupervised model and inference method for MTPPs
  in presence of missing events. We first model the generative processes of observed
  events and missing events using two MTPPs, where the missing events are represented
  as latent random variables. Then we devise an unsupervised training method that
  jointly learns both the MTPPs by means of variational inference. Experiments with
  real datasets show that our modeling and inference frameworks can effectively impute
  the missing data among the observed events, which in turn enhances its predictive
  prowess. "
