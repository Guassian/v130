title: " Near-Optimal Provable Uniform Convergence in Offline Policy Evaluation for
  Reinforcement Learning "
abstract: " The problem of \\emph{Offline Policy Evaluation} (OPE) in Reinforcement
  Learning (RL) is a critical step towards applying RL in real life applications.
  Existing work on OPE mostly focus on evaluating a \\emph{fixed} target policy $\\pi$,
  which does not provide useful bounds for offline policy learning as $\\pi$ will
  then be data-dependent. We address this problem by \\emph{simultaneously} evaluating
  all policies in a policy class $\\Pi$ — uniform convergence in OPE — and obtain
  nearly optimal error bounds for a number of global / local policy classes. Our results
  imply that the model-based planning achieves an optimal episode complexity of $\\widetilde{O}(H^3/d_m\\epsilon^2)$
  in identifying an $\\epsilon$-optimal policy under the \\emph{time-inhomogeneous
  episodic} MDP model ($H$ is the planning horizon, $d_m$ is a quantity that reflects
  the exploration of the logging policy $\\mu$). To the best of our knowledge, this
  is the first time the optimal rate is shown to be possible for the offline RL setting
  and the paper is the first that systematically investigates the uniform convergence
  in OPE. "
