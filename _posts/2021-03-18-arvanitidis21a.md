title: " Geometrically Enriched Latent Spaces "
abstract: " A common assumption in generative models is that the generator immerses
  the latent space into a Euclidean ambient space. Instead, we consider the ambient
  space to be a Riemannian manifold, which allows for encoding domain knowledge through
  the associated Riemannian metric. Shortest paths can then be defined accordingly
  in the latent space to both follow the learned manifold and respect the ambient
  geometry. Through careful design of the ambient metric we can ensure that shortest
  paths are well-behaved even for deterministic generators that otherwise would exhibit
  a misleading bias. Experimentally we show that our approach improves the interpretability
  and the functionality of learned representations both using stochastic and deterministic
  generators. "
