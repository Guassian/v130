title: " Good Classifiers are Abundant in the Interpolating Regime "
abstract: " Within the machine learning community, the widely-used uniform convergence
  framework has been used to answer the question of how complex, over-parameterized
  models can generalize well to new data. This approach bounds the test error of the
  \\emph{worst-case} model one could have fit to the data, but it has fundamental
  limitations. Inspired by the statistical mechanics approach to learning, we formally
  define and develop a methodology to compute precisely the full distribution of test
  errors among interpolating classifiers from several model classes. We apply our
  method to compute this distribution for several real and synthetic datasets, with
  both linear and random feature classification models. We find that test errors tend
  to concentrate around a small \\emph{typical} value $\\varepsilon^*$, which deviates
  substantially from the test error of the worst-case interpolating model on the same
  datasets, indicating that “bad” classifiers are extremely rare. We provide theoretical
  results in a simple setting in which we characterize the full asymptotic distribution
  of test errors, and we show that these indeed concentrate around a value $\\varepsilon^*$,
  which we also identify exactly. We then formalize a more general conjecture supported
  by our empirical findings. Our results show that the usual style of analysis in
  statistical learning theory may not be fine-grained enough to capture the good generalization
  performance observed in practice, and that approaches based on the statistical mechanics
  of learning may offer a promising alternative. "
