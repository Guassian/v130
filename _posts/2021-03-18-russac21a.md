title: " Self-Concordant Analysis of Generalized Linear Bandits with Forgetting "
abstract: " Contextual sequential decision problems with categorical or numerical
  observations are ubiquitous and Generalized Linear Bandits (GLB) offer a solid theoretical
  framework to address them. In contrast to the case of linear bandits, existing algorithms
  for GLB have two drawbacks undermining their applicability. First, they rely on
  excessively pessimistic concentration bounds due to the non-linear nature of the
  model. Second, they require either non-convex projection steps or burn-in phases
  to enforce boundedness of the estimators. Both of these issues are worsened when
  considering non-stationary models, in which the GLB parameter may vary with time.
  In this work, we focus on self-concordant GLB (which include logistic and Poisson
  regression) with forgetting achieved either by the use of a sliding window or exponential
  weights. We propose a novel confidence-based algorithm for the maximum-likehood
  estimator with forgetting and analyze its perfomance in abruptly changing environments.
  These results as well as the accompanying numerical simulations highlight the potential
  of the proposed approach to address non-stationarity in GLB. "
