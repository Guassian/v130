title: " The Multiple Instance Learning Gaussian Process Probit Model "
abstract: " In the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) scenario, the training data consists
  of instances grouped into bags. Bag labels indicate whether each bag contains at
  least one positive instance, but instance labels are not observed. Recently, Haussmann
  et al (CVPR 2017) tackled the MIL instance label prediction task by introducing
  the Multiple Instance Learning Gaussian Process Logistic (MIL-GP-Logistic) model,
  an adaptation of the Gaussian Process Logistic Classification model that inherits
  its uncertainty quantification and flexibility. Notably, they provide a fast mean-field
  variational inference procedure. However, due to their choice of the logistic link,
  they do not maximize the ELBO objective directly, but rather a lower bound on it.
  This approximation, as we show, hurts predictive performance. In this work, we propose
  the Multiple Instance Learning Gaussian Process Probit (MIL-GP-Probit) model, an
  adaptation of the Gaussian Process Probit Classification model to solve the MIL
  instance label prediction problem. Leveraging the analytical tractability of the
  probit link, we give a variational inference procedure based on variable augmentation
  that maximizes the ELBO objective directly. Applying it, we show MIL-GP-Probit is
  significantly more calibrated than MIL-GP-Logistic on all 20 datasets of the benchmark
  20 Newsgroups dataset collection, and achieves higher AUC than MIL-GP-Logistic on
  an additional 51 out of 59 datasets. Furthermore, we show how the probit formulation
  enables principled bag label predictions and a Gibbs sampling scheme. This is the
  first exact posterior inference procedure for any Bayesian model for the MIL scenario. "
