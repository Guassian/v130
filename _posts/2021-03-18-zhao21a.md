title: " Right Decisions from Wrong Predictions: A Mechanism Design Alternative to
  Individual Calibration "
abstract: " Decision makers often need to rely on imperfect probabilistic forecasts.
  While average performance metrics are typically available, it is difficult to assess
  the quality of individual forecasts and the corresponding utilities. To convey confidence
  about individual predictions to decision-makers, we propose a compensation mechanism
  ensuring that the forecasted utility matches the actually accrued utility. While
  a naive scheme to compensate decision-makers for prediction errors can be exploited
  and might not be sustainable in the long run, we propose a mechanism based on fair
  bets and online learning that provably cannot be exploited. We demonstrate an application
  showing how passengers could confidently optimize individual travel plans based
  on flight delay probabilities estimated by an airline. "
