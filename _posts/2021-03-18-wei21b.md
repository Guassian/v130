title: " Direct Loss Minimization for Sparse Gaussian Processes "
abstract: " The paper provides a thorough investigation of Direct Loss Minimization
  (DLM), which optimizes the posterior to minimize predictive loss, in sparse Gaussian
  processes. For the conjugate case, we consider DLM for log-loss and DLM for square
  loss showing a significant performance improvement in both cases. The application
  of DLM in non-conjugate cases is more complex because the logarithm of expectation
  in the log-loss DLM objective is often intractable and simple sampling leads to
  biased estimates of gradients. The paper makes two technical contributions to address
  this. First, a new method using product sampling is proposed, which gives unbiased
  estimates of gradients (uPS) for the objective function. Second, a theoretical analysis
  of biased Monte Carlo estimates (bMC) shows that stochastic gradient descent converges
  despite the biased gradients. Experiments demonstrate empirical success of DLM.
  A comparison of the sampling methods shows that, while uPS is potentially more sample-efficient,
  bMC provides a better tradeoff in terms of convergence time and computational efficiency. "
