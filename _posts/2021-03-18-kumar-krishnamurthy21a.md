title: " Tractable contextual bandits beyond realizability "
abstract: " Tractable contextual bandit algorithms often rely on the realizability
  assumption â€“ i.e., that the true expected reward model belongs to a known class,
  such as linear functions. In this work, we present a tractable bandit algorithm
  that is not sensitive to the realizability assumption and computationally reduces
  to solving a constrained regression problem in every epoch. When realizability does
  not hold, our algorithm ensures the same guarantees on regret achieved by realizability-based
  algorithms under realizability, up to an additive term that accounts for the misspecification
  error. This extra term is proportional to T times a function of the mean squared
  error between the best model in the class and the true model, where T is the total
  number of time-steps. Our work sheds light on the bias-variance trade-off for tractable
  contextual bandits. This trade-off is not captured by algorithms that assume realizability,
  since under this assumption there exists an estimator in the class that attains
  zero bias. "
