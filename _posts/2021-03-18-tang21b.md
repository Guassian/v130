title: " Hindsight Expectation Maximization for Goal-conditioned Reinforcement Learning "
abstract: " We propose a graphical model framework for goal-conditioned RL, with an
  EM algorithm that operates on the lower bound of the RL objective. The E-step provides
  a natural interpretation of how ’learning in hindsight’ techniques, such as HER,
  to handle extremely sparse goal-conditioned rewards. The M-step reduces policy optimization
  to supervised learning updates, which greatly stabilizes end-to-end training on
  high-dimensional inputs such as images. We show that the combined algorithm, hEM
  significantly outperforms model-free baselines on a wide range of goal-conditioned
  benchmarks with sparse rewards. "
