title: " Approximation Algorithms for Orthogonal Non-negative Matrix Factorization "
abstract: " In the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) problem, the input is an
  $m\\times n$ matrix $M$ with non-negative entries and the goal is to factorize it
  as $M\\approx AW$. The $m\\times k$ matrix $A$ and the $k\\times n$ matrix $W$ are
  both constrained to have non-negative entries. This is in contrast to singular value
  decomposition, where the matrices $A$ and $W$ can have negative entries but must
  satisfy the orthogonality constraint: the columns of $A$ are orthogonal and the
  rows of $W$ are also orthogonal. The orthogonal non-negative matrix factorization
  (ONMF) problem imposes both the non-negativity and the orthogonality constraints,
  and previous work showed that it leads to better performances than NMF on many clustering
  tasks. We give the first constant-factor approximation algorithm for ONMF when one
  or both of $A$ and $W$ are subject to the orthogonality constraint. We also show
  an interesting connection to the correlation clustering problem on bipartite graphs.
  Our experiments on synthetic and real-world data show that our algorithm achieves
  similar or smaller errors compared to previous ONMF algorithms while ensuring perfect
  orthogonality (many previous algorithms do not satisfy the hard orthogonality constraint). "
