title: " Linearly Constrained Gaussian Processes with Boundary Conditions "
abstract: " One goal in Bayesian machine learning is to encode prior knowledge into
  prior distributions, to model data efficiently. We consider prior knowledge from
  systems of linear partial differential equations together with their boundary conditions.
  We construct multi-output Gaussian process priors with realizations in the solution
  set of such systems, in particular only such solutions can be represented by Gaussian
  process regression. The construction is fully algorithmic via Gr√∂bner bases and
  it does not employ any approximation. It builds these priors combining two parametrizations
  via a pullback: the first parametrizes the solutions for the system of differential
  equations and the second parametrizes all functions adhering to the boundary conditions. "
