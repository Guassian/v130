title: " Corralling Stochastic Bandit Algorithms "
abstract: " We study the problem of corralling stochastic bandit algorithms, that
  is combining multiple bandit algorithms designed for a stochastic environment, with
  the goal of devising a corralling algorithm that performs almost as well as the
  best base algorithm. We give two general algorithms for this setting, which we show
  benefit from favorable regret guarantees. We show that the regret of the corralling
  algorithms is no worse than that of the best algorithm containing the arm with the
  highest reward, and depends on the gap between the highest reward and other rewards. "
