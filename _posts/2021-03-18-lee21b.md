title: " Reinforcement Learning for Mean Field Games with Strategic Complementarities "
abstract: " Mean Field Games (MFG) are the class of games with a very large number
  of agents and the standard equilibrium concept is a Mean Field Equilibrium (MFE).
  Algorithms for learning MFE in dynamic MFGs are unknown in general. Our focus is
  on an important subclass that possess a monotonicity property called Strategic Complementarities
  (MFG-SC). We introduce a natural refinement to the equilibrium concept that we call
  Trembling-Hand-Perfect MFE (T-MFE), which allows agents to employ a measure of randomization
  while accounting for the impact of such randomization on their payoffs. We propose
  a simple algorithm for computing T-MFE under a known model. We also introduce a
  model-free and a model-based approach to learning T-MFE and provide sample complexities
  of both algorithms. We also develop a fully online learning scheme that obviates
  the need for a simulator. Finally, we empirically evaluate the performance of the
  proposed algorithms via examples motivated by real-world applications. "
