title: " Federated Multi-armed Bandits with Personalization "
abstract: " A general framework of personalized federated multi-armed bandits (PF-MAB)
  is proposed, which is a new bandit paradigm analogous to the federated learning
  (FL) framework in supervised learning and enjoys the features of FL with personalization.
  Under the PF-MAB framework, a mixed bandit learning problem that flexibly balances
  generalization and personalization is studied. A lower bound analysis for the mixed
  model is presented. We then propose the Personalized Federated Upper Confidence
  Bound (PF-UCB) algorithm, where the exploration length is chosen carefully to achieve
  the desired balance of learning the local model and supplying global information
  for the mixed learning objective. Theoretical analysis proves that PF-UCB achieves
  an O(log(T)) regret regardless of the degree of personalization, and has a similar
  instance dependency as the lower bound. Experiments using both synthetic and real-world
  datasets corroborate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness
  of the proposed algorithm. "
