title: " Goodness-of-Fit Test for Mismatched Self-Exciting Processes "
abstract: " Recently there have been many research efforts in developing generative
  models for self-exciting point processes, partly due to their broad applicability
  for real-world applications. However, rarely can we quantify how well the generative
  model captures the nature or ground-truth since it is usually unknown. The challenge
  typically lies in the fact that the generative models typically provide, at most,
  good approximations to the ground-truth (e.g., through the rich representative power
  of neural networks), but they cannot be precisely the ground-truth. We thus cannot
  use the classic goodness-of-fit (GOF) test framework to evaluate their performance.
  In this paper, we develop a GOF test for generative models of self-exciting processes
  by making a new connection to this problem with the classical statistical theory
  of Quasi-maximum-likelihood estimator (QMLE). We present a non-parametric self-normalizing
  statistic for the GOF test: the Generalized Score (GS) statistics, and explicitly
  capture the model misspecification when establishing the asymptotic distribution
  of the GS statistic. Numerical simulation and real-data experiments validate our
  theory and demonstrate the proposed GS testâ€™s good performance. "
