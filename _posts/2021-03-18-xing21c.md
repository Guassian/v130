title: " Adversarially Robust Estimate and Risk Analysis in Linear Regression "
abstract: " Adversarial robust learning aims to design algorithms that are robust
  to small adversarial perturbations on input variables. Beyond the existing studies
  on the predictive performance to adversarial samples, our goal is to understand
  statistical properties of adversarial robust estimates and analyze adversarial risk
  in the setup of linear regression models. By discovering the statistical minimax
  rate of convergence of adversarial robust estimators, we emphasize the importance
  of incorporating model information, e.g., sparsity, in adversarial robust learning.
  Further, we reveal an explicit connection of adversarial and standard estimates,
  and propose a straightforward two-stage adversarial training framework, which facilitates
  to utilize model structure information to improve adversarial robustness. In theory,
  the consistency of the adversarial robust estimator is proven and its Bahadur representation
  is also developed for the statistical inference purpose. The proposed estimator
  converges in a sharp rate under either low-dimensional or sparse scenario. Moreover,
  our theory confirms two phenomena in adversarial robust learning: adversarial robustness
  hurts generalization, and unlabeled data help improve the generalization. In the
  end, we conduct numerical simulations to verify our theory. "
