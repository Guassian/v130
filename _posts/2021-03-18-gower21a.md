title: " SGD for Structured Nonconvex Functions: Learning Rates, Minibatching and
  Interpolation "
abstract: " Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is being used routinely for optimizing
  non-convex functions. Yet, the standard convergence theory for SGD in the smooth
  non-convex setting gives a slow sublinear convergence to a stationary point. In
  this work, we provide several convergence theorems for SGD showing convergence to
  a global minimum for non-convex problems satisfying some extra structural assumptions.
  In particular, we focus on two large classes of structured non-convex functions:
  (i) Quasar (Strongly) Convex functions (a generalization of convex functions) and
  (ii) functions satisfying the Polyak-≈Åojasiewicz condition (a generalization of
  strongly-convex functions). Our analysis relies on an Expected Residual condition
  which we show is a strictly weaker assumption than previously used growth conditions,
  expected smoothness or bounded variance assumptions. We provide theoretical guarantees
  for the convergence of SGD for different step-size selections including constant,
  decreasing and the recently proposed stochastic Polyak step-size. In addition, all
  of our analysis holds for the arbitrary sampling paradigm, and as such, we give
  insights into the complexity of minibatching and determine an optimal minibatch
  size. Finally, we show that for models that interpolate the training data, we can
  dispense of our Expected Residual condition and give state-of-the-art results in
  this setting. "
