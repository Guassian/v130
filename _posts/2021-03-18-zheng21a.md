title: " Federated f-Differential Privacy "
abstract: " Federated learning (FL) is a training paradigm where the clients collaboratively
  learn models by repeatedly sharing information without compromising much on the
  privacy of their local sensitive data. In this paper, we introduce \\emph{federated
  $f$-differential privacy}, a new notion specifically tailored to the federated setting,
  based on the framework of Gaussian differential privacy. Federated $f$-differential
  privacy operates on \\emph{record level}: it provides the privacy guarantee on each
  individual record of one clientâ€™s data against adversaries. We then propose a generic
  private federated learning framework \\fedsync that accommodates a large family
  of state-of-the-art FL algorithms, which provably achieves {federated $f$-differential
  privacy}. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the trade-off between privacy guarantee
  and prediction performance for models trained by \\fedsync in computer vision tasks. "
