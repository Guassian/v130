title: " Federated Learning with Compression: Unified Analysis and Sharp Guarantees "
abstract: " In federated learning, communication cost is often a critical bottleneck
  to scale up distributed optimization algorithms to collaboratively learn a model
  from millions of devices with potentially unreliable or limited communication and
  heterogeneous data distributions. Two notable trends to deal with the communication
  overhead of federated algorithms are gradient compression and local computation
  with periodic communication. Despite many attempts, characterizing the relationship
  between these two approaches has proven elusive. We address this by proposing a
  set of algorithms with periodical compressed (quantized or sparsified) communication
  and analyze their convergence properties in both homogeneous and heterogeneous local
  data distributions settings. For the homogeneous setting, our analysis improves
  existing bounds by providing tighter convergence rates for both strongly convex
  and non-convex objective functions. To mitigate data heterogeneity, we introduce
  a local gradient tracking scheme and obtain sharp convergence rates that match the
  best-known communication complexities without compression for convex, strongly convex,
  and nonconvex settings. We complement our theoretical results by demonstrating the
  effectiveness of our proposed methods on real-world datasets. "
