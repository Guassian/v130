title: " γ-ABC: Outlier-Robust Approximate Bayesian Computation Based on a Robust
  Divergence Estimator "
abstract: " Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is a likelihood-free inference
  method that has been employed in various applications. However, ABC can be sensitive
  to outliers if a data discrepancy measure is chosen inappropriately. In this paper,
  we propose to use a nearest-neighbor-based γ-divergence estimator as a data discrepancy
  measure. We show that our estimator possesses a suitable robustness property called
  the redescending property. In addition, our estimator enjoys various desirable properties
  such as high flexibility, asymptotic unbiasedness, almost sure convergence, and
  linear time complexity. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our method achieves
  significantly higher robustness than existing discrepancy measures. "
