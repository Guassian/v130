title: " Quick Streaming Algorithms for Maximization of Monotone Submodular Functions
  in Linear Time "
abstract: " We consider the problem of monotone, submodular maximization over a ground
  set of size $n$ subject to cardinality constraint $k$. For this problem, we introduce
  the first deterministic algorithms with linear time complexity; these algorithms
  are streaming algorithms. Our single-pass algorithm obtains a constant ratio in
  $\\lceil n / c \\rceil + c$ oracle queries, for any $c \\ge 1$. In addition, we
  propose a deterministic, multi-pass streaming algorithm with a constant number of
  passes that achieves nearly the optimal ratio with linear query and time complexities.
  We prove a lower bound that implies no constant-factor approximation exists using
  $o(n)$ queries, even if queries to infeasible sets are allowed. An empirical analysis
  demonstrates that our algorithms require fewer queries (often substantially less
  than $n$) yet still achieve better objective value than the current state-of-the-art
  algorithms, including single-pass, multi-pass, and non-streaming algorithms. "
