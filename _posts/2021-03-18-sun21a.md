title: " Amortized Bayesian Prototype Meta-learning: A New Probabilistic Meta-learning
  Approach to Few-shot Image Classification "
abstract: " Probabilistic meta-learning methods recently have achieved impressive
  success in few-shot image classification. However, they introduce a huge number
  of random variables for neural network weights and thus severe computational and
  inferential challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic meta-learning
  method called amortized Bayesian prototype meta-learning. In contrast to previous
  methods, we introduce only a small number of random variables for latent class prototypes
  rather than a huge number for network weights; we learn to learn the posterior distributions
  of these latent prototypes in an amortized inference way with no need for an extra
  amortization network, such that we can easily approximate their posteriors conditional
  on few labeled samples, whenever at meta-training or meta-testing stage. The proposed
  method can be trained end-to-end without any pre-training. Compared with other probabilistic
  meta-learning methods, our proposed approach is more interpretable with much less
  random variables, while still be able to achieve competitive performance for few-shot
  image classification problems on various benchmark datasets. Its excellent robustness
  and predictive uncertainty are also demonstrated through ablation studies. "
