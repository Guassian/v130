title: " A Stein Goodness-of-test for Exponential Random Graph Models "
abstract: " We propose and analyse a novel nonparametric goodness-of-fit testing procedure
  for ex-changeable exponential random graph model (ERGM) when a single network realisation
  is observed. The test determines how likely it is that the observation is generated
  from a target unnormalised ERGM density. Our test statistics are derived of kernel
  Stein discrepancy, a divergence constructed via Steinâ€™s method using functions from
  a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), combined with a discrete Stein operator
  for ERGMs. The test is a Monte Carlo test using simulated networks from the target
  ERGM. We show theoretical properties for the testing procedure w.r.t a class of
  ERGMs. Simulation studies and real network applications are presented. "
