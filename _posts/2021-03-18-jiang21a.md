title: " Learning to Defend by Learning to Attack "
abstract: " Adversarial training provides a principled approach for training robust
  neural networks. From an optimization perspective, adversarial training is essentially
  solving a bilevel optimization problem. The leader problem is trying to learn a
  robust classifier, while the follower maximization is trying to generate adversarial
  samples. Unfortunately, such a bilevel problem is difficult to solve due to its
  highly complicated structure. This work proposes a new adversarial training method
  based on a generic learning-to-learn (L2L) framework. Specifically, instead of applying
  existing hand-designed algorithms for the inner problem, we learn an optimizer,
  which is parametrized as a convolutional neural network. At the same time, a robust
  classifier is learned to defense the adversarial attack generated by the learned
  optimizer. Experiments over CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that L2L
  outperforms existing adversarial training methods in both classification accuracy
  and computational efficiency. Moreover, our L2L framework can be extended to generative
  adversarial imitation learning and stabilize the training. "
