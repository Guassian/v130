title: " Free-rider Attacks on Model Aggregation in Federated Learning "
abstract: " Free-rider attacks against federated learning consist in dissimulating
  participation to the federated learning process with the goal of obtaining the final
  aggregated model without actually contributing with any data. This kind of attacks
  are critical in sensitive applications of federated learning when data is scarce
  and the model has high commercial value. We introduce here the first theoretical
  and experimental analysis of free-rider attacks on federated learning schemes based
  on iterative parameters aggregation, such as FedAvg or FedProx, and provide formal
  guarantees for these attacks to converge to the aggregated models of the fair participants.
  We first show that a straightforward implementation of this attack can be simply
  achieved by not updating the local parameters during the iterative federated optimization.
  As this attack can be detected by adopting simple countermeasures at the server
  level, we subsequently study more complex disguising schemes based on stochastic
  updates of the free-rider parameters. We demonstrate the proposed strategies on
  a number of experimental scenarios, in both iid and non-iid settings. We conclude
  by providing recommendations to avoid free-rider attacks in real world applications
  of federated learning, especially in sensitive domains where security of data and
  models is critical. "
