title: " Hogwild! over Distributed Local Data Sets with Linearly Increasing Mini-Batch
  Sizes "
abstract: " Hogwild! implements asynchronous Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) where
  multiple threads in parallel access a common repository containing training data,
  perform SGD iterations and update shared state that represents a jointly learned
  (global) model. We consider big data analysis where training data is distributed
  among local data sets in a heterogeneous way – and we wish to move SGD computations
  to local compute nodes where local data resides. The results of these local SGD
  computations are aggregated by a central “aggregator” which mimics Hogwild!. We
  show how local compute nodes can start choosing small mini-batch sizes which increase
  to larger ones in order to reduce communication cost (round interaction with the
  aggregator). We improve state-of-the-art literature and show O(K^{0.5}) communication
  rounds for heterogeneous data for strongly convex problems, where K is the total
  number of gradient computations across all local compute nodes. For our scheme,
  we prove a tight and novel non-trivial convergence analysis for strongly convex
  problems for heterogeneous data which does not use the bounded gradient assumption
  as seen in many existing publications. The tightness is a consequence of our proofs
  for lower and upper bounds of the convergence rate, which show a constant factor
  difference. We show experimental results for plain convex and non-convex problems
  for biased (i.e., heterogeneous) and unbiased local data sets. "
