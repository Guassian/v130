title: " Bayesian Active Learning by Soft Mean Objective Cost of Uncertainty "
abstract: " To achieve label efficiency for training supervised learning models, pool-based
  active learning sequentially selects samples from a set of candidates as queries
  to label by optimizing an acquisition function. One category of existing methods
  adopts one-step-look-ahead strategies based on acquisition functions tailored with
  the learning objectives, for example based on the expected loss reduction (ELR)
  or the mean objective cost of uncertainty (MOCU) proposed recently. These active
  learning methods are optimal with the maximum classification error reduction when
  one considers a single query. However, it is well-known that there is no performance
  guarantee in the long run for these myopic methods. In this paper, we show that
  these methods are not guaranteed to converge to the optimal classifier of the true
  model because MOCU is not strictly concave. Moreover, we suggest a strictly concave
  approximation of MOCU—Soft MOCU—that can be used to define an acquisition function
  to guide Bayesian active learning with theoretical convergence guarantee. For training
  Bayesian classifiers with both synthetic and real-world data, our experiments demonstrate
  the superior performance of active learning by Soft MOCU compared to other existing
  methods. "
