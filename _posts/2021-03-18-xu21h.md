title: " DebiNet: Debiasing Linear Models with Nonlinear Overparameterized Neural
  Networks "
abstract: " Recent years have witnessed strong empirical performance of over-parameterized
  neural networks on various tasks and many advances in the theory, e.g. the universal
  approximation and provable convergence to global minimum. In this paper, we incorporate
  over-parameterized neural networks into semi-parametric models to bridge the gap
  between inference and prediction, especially in the high dimensional linear problem.
  By doing so, we can exploit a wide class of networks to approximate the nuisance
  functions and to estimate the parameters of interest consistently. Therefore, we
  may offer the best of two worlds: the universal approximation ability from neural
  networks and the interpretability from classic ordinary linear model, leading to
  valid inference and accurate prediction. We show the theoretical foundations that
  make this possible and demonstrate with numerical experiments. Furthermore, we propose
  a framework, DebiNet, in which we plug-in arbitrary feature selection methods to
  our semi-parametric neural network and illustrate that our framework debiases the
  regularized estimators and performs well, in terms of the post-selection inference
  and the generalization error. "
