title: " Confident Off-Policy Evaluation and Selection through Self-Normalized Importance
  Weighting "
abstract: " We consider off-policy evaluation in the contextual bandit setting for
  the purpose of obtaining a robust off-policy selection strategy, where the selection
  strategy is evaluated based on the value of the chosen policy in a set of proposal
  (target) policies. We propose a new method to compute a lower bound on the value
  of an arbitrary target policy given some logged data in contextual bandits for a
  desired coverage. The lower bound is built around the so-called Self-normalized
  Importance Weighting (SN) estimator. It combines the use of a semi-empirical Efron-Stein
  tail inequality to control the concentration and Harrisâ€™ inequality to control the
  bias. The new approach is evaluated on a number of synthetic and real datasets and
  is found to be superior to its main competitors, both in terms of tightness of the
  confidence intervals and the quality of the policies chosen. "
