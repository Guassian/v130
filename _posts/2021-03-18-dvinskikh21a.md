title: " Improved Complexity Bounds in Wasserstein Barycenter Problem "
abstract: " In this paper, we focus on computational aspects of the Wasserstein barycenter
  problem. We propose two algorithms to compute Wasserstein barycenters of $m$ discrete
  measures of size $n$ with accuracy $\\e$. The first algorithm, based on mirror prox
  with a specific norm, meets the complexity of celebrated accelerated iterative Bregman
  projections (IBP), namely $\\widetilde O(mn^2\\sqrt n/\\e)$, however, with no limitations
  in contrast to the (accelerated) IBP, which is numerically unstable under small
  regularization parameter. The second algorithm, based on area-convexity and dual
  extrapolation, improves the previously best-known convergence rates for the Wasserstein
  barycenter problem enjoying $\\widetilde O(mn^2/\\e)$ complexity. "
