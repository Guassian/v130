title: " All of the Fairness for Edge Prediction with Optimal Transport "
abstract: " Machine learning and data mining algorithms have been increasingly used
  recently to support decision-making systems in many areas of high societal importance
  such as healthcare, education, or security. While being very efficient in their
  predictive abilities, the deployed algorithms sometimes tend to learn an inductive
  model with a discriminative bias due to the presence of this latter in the learning
  sample. This problem gave rise to a new field of algorithmic fairness where the
  goal is to correct the discriminative bias introduced by a certain attribute in
  order to decorrelate it from the modelâ€™s output. In this paper, we study the problem
  of fairness for the task of edge prediction in graphs, a largely underinvestigated
  scenario compared to a more popular setting of fair classification. To this end,
  we formulate the problem of fair edge prediction, analyze it theoretically, and
  propose an embedding-agnostic repairing procedure for the adjacency matrix of an
  arbitrary graph with a trade-off between the group and individual fairness. We experimentally
  show the versatility of our approach and its capacity to provide explicit control
  over different notions of fairness and prediction accuracy. "
