title: " Non-asymptotic Performance Guarantees for Neural Estimation of f-Divergences "
abstract: " Statistical distances (SDs), which quantify the dissimilarity between
  probability distributions, are central to machine learning and statistics. A modern
  method for estimating such distances from data relies on parametrizing a variational
  form by a neural network (NN) and optimizing it. These estimators are abundantly
  used in practice, but corresponding performance guarantees are partial and call
  for further exploration. In particular, there seems to be a fundamental tradeoff
  between the two sources of error involved: approximation and estimation. While the
  former needs the NN class to be rich and expressive, the latter relies on controlling
  complexity. This paper explores this tradeoff by means of non-asymptotic error bounds,
  focusing on three popular choices of SDsâ€”Kullback-Leibler divergence, chi-squared
  divergence, and squared Hellinger distance. Our analysis relies on non-asymptotic
  function approximation theorems and tools from empirical process theory. Numerical
  results validating the theory are also provided. "
