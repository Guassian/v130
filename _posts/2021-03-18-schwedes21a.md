title: " Rao-Blackwellised parallel MCMC "
abstract: " Multiple proposal Markov chain Monte Carlo (MP-MCMC) as introduced in
  Calderhead (2014) allow for computationally efficient and parallelisable inference,
  whereby multiple states are proposed and computed simultaneously. In this paper,
  we improve the resulting integral estimators by sequentially using the multiple
  states within a Rao-Blackwellised estimator. We further propose a novel adaptive
  Rao-Blackwellised MP-MCMC algorithm, which generalises the adaptive MCMC algorithm
  introduced by Haario et al. (2001) to allow for multiple proposals. We prove its
  asymptotic unbiasedness, and demonstrate significant improvements in sampling efficiency
  through numerical studies. "
