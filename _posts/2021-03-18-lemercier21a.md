title: " Distribution Regression for Sequential Data "
abstract: " Distribution regression refers to the supervised learning problem where
  labels are only available for groups of inputs instead of individual inputs. In
  this paper, we develop a rigorous mathematical framework for distribution regression
  where inputs are complex data streams. Leveraging properties of the expected signature
  and a recent signature kernel trick for sequential data from stochastic analysis,
  we introduce two new learning techniques, one feature-based and the other kernel-based.
  Each is suited to a different data regime in terms of the number of data streams
  and the dimensionality of the individual streams. We provide theoretical results
  on the universality of both approaches and demonstrate empirically their robustness
  to irregularly sampled multivariate time-series, achieving state-of-the-art performance
  on both synthetic and real-world examples from thermodynamics, mathematical finance
  and agricultural science. "
