title: " Deep Spectral Ranking "
abstract: " Learning from ranking observations arises in many domains, and siamese
  deep neural networks have shown excellent inference performance in this setting.
  However, SGD does not scale well, as an epoch grows exponentially with the ranking
  observation size. We show that a spectral algorithm can be combined with deep learning
  methods to significantly accelerate training. We combine a spectral estimate of
  Plackett-Luce ranking scores with a deep model via the Alternating Directions Method
  of Multipliers with a Kullback-Leibler proximal penalty. Compared to a state-of-the-art
  siamese network, our algorithms are up to 175 times faster and attain better predictions
  by up to 26% Top-1 Accuracy and 6% Kendall-Tau correlation over five real-life ranking
  datasets. "
