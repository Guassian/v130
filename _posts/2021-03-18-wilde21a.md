title: " Foundations of Bayesian Learning from Synthetic Data "
abstract: " There is significant growth and interest in the use of synthetic data
  as an enabler for machine learning in environments where the release of real data
  is restricted due to privacy or availability constraints. Despite a large number
  of methods for synthetic data generation, there are comparatively few results on
  the statistical properties of models learnt on synthetic data, and fewer still for
  situations where a researcher wishes to augment real data with another partyâ€™s synthesised
  data. We use a Bayesian paradigm to characterise the updating of model parameters
  when learning in these settings, demonstrating that caution should be taken when
  applying conventional learning algorithms without appropriate consideration of the
  synthetic data generating process and learning task at hand. Recent results from
  general Bayesian updating support a novel and robust approach to Bayesian synthetic-learning
  founded on decision theory that outperforms standard approaches across repeated
  experiments on supervised learning and inference problems. "
