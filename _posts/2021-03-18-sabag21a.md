title: " Regret-Optimal Filtering "
abstract: " We consider the problem of filtering in linear state-space models (e.g.,
  the Kalman filter setting) through the lens of regret optimization. Specifically,
  we study the problem of causally estimating a desired signal, generated by a linear
  state-space model driven by process noise, based on noisy observations of a related
  observation process. We define a novel regret criterion for estimator design as
  the difference of the estimation error energies between a clairvoyant estimator
  that has access to all future observations (a so-called smoother) and a causal one
  that only has access to current and past observations. The regret-optimal estimator
  is the causal estimator that minimizes the worst-case regret across all bounded-energy
  noise sequences. We provide a solution for the regret filtering problem at two levels.
  First, an horizon-independent solution at the operator level is obtained by reducing
  the regret to the well-known Nehari problem. Secondly, our main result for state-space
  models is an explicit estimator that achieves the optimal regret. The regret-optimal
  estimator is represented as a finite-dimensional state-space whose parameters can
  be computed by solving three Riccati equations and a single Lyapunov equation. We
  demonstrate the applicability and efficacy of the estimator in a variety of problems
  and observe that the estimator has average and worst-case performances that are
  simultaneously close to their optimal values. "
