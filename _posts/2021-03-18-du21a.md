title: " Wasserstein Random Forests and Applications in Heterogeneous Treatment Effects "
abstract: " We present new insights into causal inference in the context of Heterogeneous
  Treatment Effects by proposing natural variants of Random Forests to estimate the
  key conditional distributions. To achieve this, we recast Breiman’s original splitting
  criterion in terms of Wasserstein distances between empirical measures. This reformulation
  indicates that Random Forests are well adapted to estimate conditional distributions
  and provides a natural extension of the algorithm to multi- variate outputs. Following
  the philosophy of Breiman’s construction, we propose some variants of the splitting
  rule that are well-suited to the conditional distribution estimation problem. Some
  preliminary theoretical connections are established along with various numerical
  experiments, which show how our approach may help to conduct more transparent causal
  inference in complex situations. "
