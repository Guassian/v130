title: " Understanding the wiring evolution in differentiable neural architecture
  search "
abstract: " Controversy exists on whether differentiable neural architecture search
  methods discover wiring topology effectively. To understand how wiring topology
  evolves, we study the underlying mechanism of several existing differentiable NAS
  frameworks. Our investigation is motivated by three observed searching patterns
  of differentiable NAS: 1) they search by growing instead of pruning; 2) wider networks
  are more preferred than deeper ones; 3) no edges are selected in bi-level optimization.
  To anatomize these phenomena, we propose a unified view on searching algorithms
  of existing frameworks, transferring the global optimization to local cost minimization.
  Based on this reformulation, we conduct empirical and theoretical analyses, revealing
  implicit biases in the costâ€™s assignment mechanism and evolution dynamics that cause
  the observed phenomena. These biases indicate strong discrimination towards certain
  topologies. To this end, we pose questions that future differentiable methods for
  neural wiring discovery need to confront, hoping to evoke a discussion and rethinking
  on how much bias has been enforced implicitly in existing NAS methods. "
