title: " Learning Individually Fair Classifier with Path-Specific Causal-Effect Constraint "
abstract: " Machine learning is used to make decisions for individuals in various
  fields, which require us to achieve good prediction accuracy while ensuring fairness
  with respect to sensitive features (e.g., race and gender). This problem, however,
  remains difficult in complex real-world scenarios. To quantify unfairness under
  such situations, existing methods utilize path-specific causal effects. However,
  none of them can ensure fairness for each individual without making impractical
  functional assumptions about the data. In this paper, we propose a far more practical
  framework for learning an individually fair classifier. To avoid restrictive functional
  assumptions, we define the probability of individual unfairness (PIU) and solve
  an optimization problem where PIUâ€™s upper bound, which can be estimated from data,
  is controlled to be close to zero. We elucidate why our method can guarantee fairness
  for each individual. Experimental results show that our method can learn an individually
  fair classifier at a slight cost of accuracy. "
