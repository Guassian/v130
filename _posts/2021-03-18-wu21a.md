title: " Hadamard Wirtinger Flow for Sparse Phase Retrieval "
abstract: " We consider the problem of reconstructing an $n$-dimensional $k$-sparse
  signal from a set of noiseless magnitude-only measurements. Formulating the problem
  as an unregularized empirical risk minimization task, we study the sample complexity
  performance of gradient descent with Hadamard parametrization, which we call Hadamard
  Wirtinger flow (HWF). Provided knowledge of the signal sparsity $k$, we prove that
  a single step of HWF is able to recover the support from $k(x^*_{max})^{-2}$ (modulo
  logarithmic term) samples, where $x^*_{max}$ is the largest component of the signal
  in magnitude. This support recovery procedure can be used to initialize existing
  reconstruction methods and yields algorithms with total runtime proportional to
  the cost of reading the data and improved sample complexity, which is linear in
  $k$ when the signal contains at least one large component. We numerically investigate
  the performance of HWF at convergence and show that, while not requiring any explicit
  form of regularization nor knowledge of $k$, HWF adapts to the signal sparsity and
  reconstructs sparse signals with fewer measurements than existing gradient based
  methods. "
