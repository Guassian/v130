title: " Learning with Hyperspherical Uniformity "
abstract: " Due to the over-parameterization nature, neural networks are a powerful
  tool for nonlinear function approximation. In order to achieve good generalization
  on unseen data, a suitable inductive bias is of great importance for neural networks.
  One of the most straightforward ways is to regularize the neural network with some
  additional objectives. L2 regularization serves as a standard regularization for
  neural networks. Despite its popularity, it essentially regularizes one dimension
  of the individual neuron, which is not strong enough to control the capacity of
  highly over-parameterized neural networks. Motivated by this, hyperspherical uniformity
  is proposed as a novel family of relational regularizations that impact the interaction
  among neurons. We consider several geometrically distinct ways to achieve hyperspherical
  uniformity. The effectiveness of hyperspherical uniformity is justified by theoretical
  insights and empirical evaluations. "
