title: " Learning Bijective Feature Maps for Linear ICA "
abstract: " Separating high-dimensional data like images into independent latent factors,
  i.e independent component analysis (ICA), remains an open research problem. As we
  show, existing probabilistic deep generative models (DGMs), which are tailor-made
  for image data, underperform on non-linear ICA tasks. To address this, we propose
  a DGM which combines bijective feature maps with a linear ICA model to learn interpretable
  latent structures for high-dimensional data. Given the complexities of jointly training
  such a hybrid model, we introduce novel theory that constrains linear ICA to lie
  close to the manifold of orthogonal rectangular matrices, the Stiefel manifold.
  By doing so we create models that converge quickly, are easy to train, and achieve
  better unsupervised latent factor discovery than flow-based models, linear ICA,
  and Variational Autoencoders on images. "
