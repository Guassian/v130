title: " Generalization of Quasi-Newton Methods: Application to Robust Symmetric Multisecant
  Updates "
abstract: " Quasi-Newton (qN) techniques approximate the Newton step by estimating
  the Hessian using the so-called secant equations. Some of these methods compute
  the Hessian using several secant equations but produce non-symmetric updates. Other
  quasi-Newton schemes, such as BFGS, enforce symmetry but cannot satisfy more than
  one secant equation. We propose a new type of quasi-Newton symmetric update using
  several secant equations in a least-squares sense. Our approach generalizes and
  unifies the design of quasi-Newton updates and satisfies provable robustness guarantees. "
