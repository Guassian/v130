title: " Hierarchical Clustering in General Metric Spaces using Approximate Nearest
  Neighbors "
abstract: " Hierarchical clustering is a widely used data analysis method, but suffers
  from scalability issues, requiring quadratic time in general metric spaces. In this
  work, we demonstrate how approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) queries can be used
  to improve the running time of the popular single-linkage and average-linkage methods.
  Our proposed algorithms are the first subquadratic time algorithms for non-Euclidean
  metrics. We complement our theoretical analysis with an empirical evaluation showcasing
  our methodsâ€™ efficiency and accuracy. "
