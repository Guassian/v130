title: " Measure Transport with Kernel Stein Discrepancy "
abstract: " Measure transport underpins several recent algorithms for posterior approximation
  in the Bayesian context, wherein a transport map is sought to minimise the Kullbackâ€“Leibler
  divergence (KLD) from the posterior to the approximation. The KLD is a strong mode
  of convergence, requiring absolute continuity of measures and placing restrictions
  on which transport maps can be permitted. Here we propose to minimise a kernel Stein
  discrepancy (KSD) instead, requiring only that the set of transport maps is dense
  in an $L^2$ sense and demonstrating how this condition can be validated. The consistency
  of the associated posterior approximation is established and empirical results suggest
  that KSD is competitive and more flexible alternative to KLD for measure transport. "
