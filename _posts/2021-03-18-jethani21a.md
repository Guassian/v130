title: " Have We Learned to Explain?: How Interpretability Methods Can Learn to Encode
  Predictions in their Interpretations. "
abstract: " While the need for interpretable machine learning has been established,
  many common approaches are slow, lack fidelity, or hard to evaluate. Amortized explanation
  methods reduce the cost of providing interpretations by learning a global selector
  model that returns feature importances for a single instance of data. The selector
  model is trained to optimize the fidelity of the interpretations, as evaluated by
  a predictor model for the target. Popular methods learn the selector and predictor
  model in concert, which we show allows predictions to be encoded within interpretations.
  We introduce EVAL-X as a method to quantitatively evaluate interpretations and REAL-X
  as an amortized explanation method, which learn a predictor model that approximates
  the true data generating distribution given any subset of the input. We show EVAL-X
  can detect when predictions are encoded in interpretations and show the advantages
  of REAL-X through quantitative and radiologist evaluation. "
