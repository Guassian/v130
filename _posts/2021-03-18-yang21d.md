title: " TenIPS: Inverse Propensity Sampling for Tensor Completion "
abstract: " Tensors are widely used to represent multiway arrays of data. The recovery
  of missing entries in a tensor has been extensively studied, generally under the
  assumption that entries are missing completely at random (MCAR). However, in most
  practical settings, observations are missing not at random (MNAR): the probability
  that a given entry is observed (also called the propensity) may depend on other
  entries in the tensor or even on the value of the missing entry. In this paper,
  we study the problem of completing a partially observed tensor with MNAR observations,
  without prior information about the propensities. To complete the tensor, we assume
  that both the original tensor and the tensor of propensities have low multilinear
  rank. The algorithm first estimates the propensities using a convex relaxation and
  then predicts missing values using a higher-order SVD approach, reweighting the
  observed tensor by the inverse propensities. We provide finite-sample error bounds
  on the resulting complete tensor. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
  of our approach. "
