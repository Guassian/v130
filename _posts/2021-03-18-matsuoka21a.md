title: " Tracking Regret Bounds for Online Submodular Optimization "
abstract: " In this paper, we propose algorithms for online submodular optimization
  with tracking regret bounds. Online submodular optimization is a generic framework
  for sequential decision making used to select subsets. Existing algorithms for online
  submodular optimization have been shown to achieve small (static) regret, which
  means that the algorithmâ€™s performance is comparable to the performance of a fixed
  optimal action. Such algorithms, however, may perform poorly in an environment that
  changes over time. To overcome this problem, we apply a tracking-regret-analysis
  framework to online submodular optimization, one by which output is assessed through
  comparison with time-varying optimal subsets. We propose algorithms for submodular
  minimization, monotone submodular maximization under a size constraint, and unconstrained
  submodular maximization, and we show tracking regret bounds. In addition, we show
  that our tracking regret bound for submodular minimization is nearly tight. "
