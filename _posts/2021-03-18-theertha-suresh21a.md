title: " Robust hypothesis testing and distribution estimation in Hellinger distance "
abstract: " We propose a simple robust hypothesis test that has the same sample complexity
  as that of the optimal Neyman-Pearson test up to constants, but robust to distribution
  perturbations under Hellinger distance. We discuss the applicability of such a robust
  test for estimating distributions in Hellinger distance. We empirically demonstrate
  the power of the test on canonical distributions. "
