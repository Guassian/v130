title: " Reinforcement Learning for Constrained Markov Decision Processes "
abstract: " In this paper, we consider the problem of optimization and learning for
  constrained and multi-objective Markov decision processes, for both discounted rewards
  and expected average rewards. We formulate the problems as zero-sum games where
  one player (the agent) solves a Markov decision problem and its opponent solves
  a bandit optimization problem, which we here call Markov-Bandit games. We extend
  $Q$-learning to solve Markov-Bandit games and show that our new $Q$-learning algorithms
  converge to the optimal solutions of the zero-sum Markov-Bandit games, and hence
  converge to the optimal solutions of the constrained and multi-objective Markov
  decision problems. We provide numerical examples where we calculate the optimal
  policies and show by simulations that the algorithm converges to the calculated
  optimal policies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time Q-learning
  algorithms guarantee convergence to optimal stationary policies for the multi-objective
  Reinforcement Learning problem with discounted and expected average rewards, respectively. "
