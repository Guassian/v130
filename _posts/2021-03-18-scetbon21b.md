title: " A Spectral Analysis of Dot-product Kernels "
abstract: " We present eigenvalue decay estimates of integral operators associated
  with compositional dot-product kernels. The estimates improve on previous ones established
  for power series kernels on spheres. This allows us to obtain the volumes of balls
  in the corresponding reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We discuss the consequences
  on statistical estimation with compositional dot product kernels and highlight interesting
  trade-offs between the approximation error and the statistical error depending on
  the number of compositions and the smoothness of the kernels. "
