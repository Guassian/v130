title: " Optimal Quantisation of Probability Measures Using Maximum Mean Discrepancy "
abstract: " Several researchers have proposed minimisation of maximum mean discrepancy
  (MMD) as a method to quantise probability measures, i.e., to approximate a distribution
  by a representative point set. We consider sequential algorithms that greedily minimise
  MMD over a discrete candidate set. We propose a novel non-myopic algorithm and,
  in order to both improve statistical efficiency and reduce computational cost, we
  investigate a variant that applies this technique to a mini-batch of the candidate
  set at each iteration. When the candidate points are sampled from the target, the
  consistency of these new algorithms—and their mini-batch variants—is established.
  We demonstrate the algorithms on a range of important computational problems, including
  optimisation of nodes in Bayesian cubature and the thinning of Markov chain output. "
