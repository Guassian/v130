title: " Equitable and Optimal Transport with Multiple Agents "
abstract: " We introduce an extension of the Optimal Transport problem when multiple
  costs are involved. Considering each cost as an agent, we aim to share equally between
  agents the work of transporting one distribution to another. To do so, we minimize
  the transportation cost of the agent who works the most. Another point of view is
  when the goal is to partition equitably goods between agents according to their
  heterogeneous preferences. Here we aim to maximize the utility of the least advantaged
  agent. This is a fair division problem. Like Optimal Transport, the problem can
  be cast as a linear optimization problem. When there is only one agent, we recover
  the Optimal Transport problem. When two agents are considered, we are able to recover
  Integral Probability Metrics defined by $\\alpha$-H{รถ}lder functions, which include
  the widely-known Dudley metric. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
  time a link is given between the Dudley metric and Optimal Transport. We provide
  an entropic regularization of that problem which leads to an alternative algorithm
  faster than the standard linear program. "
