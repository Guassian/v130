title: " A Bayesian nonparametric approach to count-min sketch under power-law data
  streams "
abstract: " The count-min sketch (CMS) is a randomized data structure that provides
  estimates of tokens’ frequencies in a large data stream using a compressed representation
  of the data by random hashing. In this paper, we rely on a recent Bayesian nonparametric
  (BNP) view on the CMS to develop a novel learning-augmented CMS under power-law
  data streams. We assume that tokens in the stream are drawn from an unknown discrete
  distribution, which is endowed with a normalized inverse Gaussian process (NIGP)
  prior. Then, using distributional properties of the NIGP, we compute the posterior
  distribution of a token’s frequency in the stream, given the hashed data, and in
  turn corresponding BNP estimates. Applications to synthetic and real data show that
  our approach achieves a remarkable performance in the estimation of low-frequency
  tokens. This is known to be a desirable feature in the context of natural language
  processing, where it is indeed common in the context of the power-law behaviour
  of the data. "
