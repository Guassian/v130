title: " Recovery Guarantees for Kernel-based Clustering under Non-parametric Mixture
  Models "
abstract: " Despite the ubiquity of kernel-based clustering, surprisingly few statistical
  guarantees exist beyond settings that consider strong structural assumptions on
  the data generation process. In this work, we take a step towards bridging this
  gap by studying the statistical performance of kernel-based clustering algorithms
  under non-parametric mixture models. We provide necessary and sufficient separability
  conditions under which these algorithms can consistently recover the underlying
  true clustering. Our analysis provides guarantees for kernel clustering approaches
  without structural assumptions on the form of the component distributions. Additionally,
  we establish a key equivalence between kernel-based data-clustering and kernel density-based
  clustering. This enables us to provide consistency guarantees for kernel-based estimators
  of non-parametric mixture models. Along with theoretical implications, this connection
  could have practical implications, including in the systematic choice of the bandwidth
  of the Gaussian kernel in the context of clustering. "
