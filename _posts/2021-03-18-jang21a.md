title: " Improving Classifier Confidence using Lossy Label-Invariant Transformations "
abstract: " Providing reliable model uncertainty estimates is imperative to enabling
  robust decision making by autonomous agents and humans alike. While recently there
  have been significant advances in confidence calibration for trained models, examples
  with poor calibration persist in most calibrated models. Consequently, multiple
  techniques have been proposed that leverage label-invariant transformations of the
  input (i.e., an input manifold) to improve worst-case confidence calibration. However,
  manifold-based confidence calibration techniques generally do not scale and/or require
  expensive retraining when applied to models with large input spaces (e.g., ImageNet).
  In this paper, we present the recursive lossy label-invariant calibration (ReCal)
  technique that leverages label-invariant transformations of the input that induce
  a loss of discriminatory information to recursively group (and calibrate) inputs
  â€“ without requiring model retraining. We show that ReCal outperforms other calibration
  methods on multiple datasets, especially, on large-scale datasets such as ImageNet. "
