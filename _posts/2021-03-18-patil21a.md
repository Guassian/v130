title: " Uniform Consistency of Cross-Validation Estimators for High-Dimensional Ridge
  Regression "
abstract: " We examine generalized and leave-one-out cross-validation for ridge regression
  in a proportional asymptotic framework where the dimension of the feature space
  grows proportionally with the number of observations. Given i.i.d. samples from
  a linear model with an arbitrary feature covariance and a signal vector that is
  bounded in $\\ell_2$ norm, we show that generalized cross-validation for ridge regression
  converges almost surely to the expected out-of-sample prediction error, uniformly
  over a range of ridge regularization parameters that includes zero (and even negative
  values). We prove the analogous result for leave-one-out cross-validation. As a
  consequence, we show that ridge tuning via minimization of generalized or leave-one-out
  cross-validation asymptotically almost surely delivers the optimal level of regularization
  for predictive accuracy, whether it be positive, negative, or zero. "
