title: " On the Effect of Auxiliary Tasks on Representation Dynamics "
abstract: " While auxiliary tasks play a key role in shaping the representations learnt
  by reinforcement learning agents, much is still unknown about the mechanisms through
  which this is achieved. This work develops our understanding of the relationship
  between auxiliary tasks, environment structure, and representations by analysing
  the dynamics of temporal difference algorithms. Through this approach, we establish
  a connection between the spectral decomposition of the transition operator and the
  representations induced by a variety of auxiliary tasks. We then leverage insights
  from these theoretical results to inform the selection of auxiliary tasks for deep
  reinforcement learning agents in sparse-reward environments. "
