title: " Stochastic Bandits with Linear Constraints "
abstract: " We study a constrained contextual linear bandit setting, where the goal
  of the agent is to produce a sequence of policies, whose expected cumulative reward
  over the course of multiple rounds is maximum, and each one of them has an expected
  cost below a certain threshold. We propose an upper-confidence bound algorithm for
  this problem, called optimistic pessimistic linear bandit (OPLB), and prove a sublinear
  bound on its regret that is inversely proportional to the difference between the
  constraint threshold and the cost of a known feasible action. Our algorithm balances
  exploration and constraint satisfaction using a novel idea that scales the radii
  of the reward and cost confidence sets with different scaling factors. We further
  specialize our results to multi-armed bandits and propose a computationally efficient
  algorithm for this setting and prove a a regret bound that is better than simply
  casting multi-armed bandits as an instance of linear bandits and using the regret
  bound of OPLB. We also prove a lower-bound for the problem studied in the paper
  and provide simulations to validate our theoretical results. Finally, we show how
  our algorithm and analysis can be extended to multiple constraints and to the case
  when the cost of the feasible action is unknown. "
