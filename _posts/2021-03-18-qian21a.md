title: " Understanding Gradient Clipping In Incremental Gradient Methods "
abstract: " We provide a theoretical analysis on how gradient clipping affects the
  convergence of the incremental gradient methods on minimizing an objective function
  that is the sum of a large number of component functions. We show that clipping
  on gradients of component functions leads to bias on the descent direction, which
  is affected by the clipping threshold, the norms of gradients of component functions,
  together with the angles between gradients of component functions and the full gradient.
  We then propose some sufficient conditions under which the increment gradient methods
  with gradient clipping can be shown to be convergent under the more general relaxed
  smoothness assumption. We also empirically observe that the angles between gradients
  of component functions and the full gradient generally decrease as the batchsize
  increases, which may help to explain why larger batchsizes generally lead to faster
  convergence in training deep neural networks with gradient clipping. "
