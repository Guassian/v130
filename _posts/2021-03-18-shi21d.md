title: " On Multilevel Monte Carlo Unbiased Gradient Estimation for Deep Latent Variable
  Models "
abstract: " Standard variational schemes for training deep latent variable models
  rely on biased gradient estimates of the target objective. Techniques based on the
  Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO), and tighter variants obtained via importance sampling,
  produce biased gradient estimates of the true log-likelihood. The family of Reweighted
  Wake-Sleep (RWS) methods further relies on a biased estimator of the inference objective,
  which biases training of the encoder also. In this work, we show how Multilevel
  Monte Carlo (MLMC) can provide a natural framework for debiasing these methods with
  two different estimators. We prove rigorously that this approach yields unbiased
  gradient estimators with finite variance under reasonable conditions. Furthermore,
  we investigate methods that can reduce variance and ensure finite variance in practice.
  Finally, we show empirically that the proposed unbiased estimators outperform IWAE
  and other debiasing method on a variety of applications at the same expected cost. "
