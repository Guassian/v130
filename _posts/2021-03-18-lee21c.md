title: " SDF-Bayes: Cautious Optimism in Safe Dose-Finding Clinical Trials with Drug
  Combinations and Heterogeneous Patient Groups "
abstract: " Phase I clinical trials are designed to test the safety (non-toxicity)
  of drugs and find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). This task becomes significantly
  more challenging when multiple-drug dose-combinations (DC) are involved, due to
  the inherent conflict between the exponentially increasing DC candidates and the
  limited patient budget. This paper proposes a novel Bayesian design, SDF-Bayes,
  for finding the MTD for drug combinations in the presence of safety constraints.
  Rather than the conventional principle of escalating or de-escalating the current
  dose of one drug (perhaps alternating between drugs), SDF-Bayes proceeds by cautious
  optimism: it chooses the next DC that, on the basis of current information, is most
  likely to be the MTD (optimism), subject to the constraint that it only chooses
  DCs that have a high probability of being safe (caution). We also propose an extension,
  SDF-Bayes-AR, that accounts for patient heterogeneity and enables heterogeneous
  patient recruitment. Extensive experiments based on both synthetic and real-world
  datasets demonstrate the advantages of SDF-Bayes over state of the art DC trial
  designs in terms of accuracy and safety. "
