title: " GANs with Conditional Independence Graphs: On Subadditivity of Probability
  Divergences "
abstract: " Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are modern methods to learn the
  underlying distribution of a data set. GANs have been widely used in sample synthesis,
  de-noising, domain transfer, etc. GANs, however, are designed in a model-free fashion
  where no additional information about the underlying distribution is available.
  In many applications, however, practitioners have access to the underlying independence
  graph of the variables, either as a Bayesian network or a Markov Random Field (MRF).
  We ask: how can one use this additional information in designing model-based GANs?
  In this paper, we provide theoretical foundations to answer this question by studying
  subadditivity properties of probability divergences, which establish upper bounds
  on the distance between two high-dimensional distributions by the sum of distances
  between their marginals over (local) neighborhoods of the graphical structure of
  the Bayes-net or the MRF. We prove that several popular probability divergences
  satisfy some notion of subadditivity under mild conditions. These results lead to
  a principled design of a model-based GAN that uses a set of simple discriminators
  on the neighborhoods of the Bayes-net/MRF, rather than a giant discriminator on
  the entire network, providing significant statistical and computational benefits.
  Our experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the benefits of
  our principled design of model-based GANs. "
