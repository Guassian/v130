title: " The Spectrum of Fisher Information of Deep Networks Achieving Dynamical Isometry "
abstract: " The Fisher information matrix (FIM) is fundamental to understanding the
  trainability of deep neural nets (DNN), since it describes the parameter space’s
  local metric. We investigate the spectral distribution of the conditional FIM, which
  is the FIM given a single sample, by focusing on fully-connected networks achieving
  dynamical isometry. Then, while dynamical isometry is known to keep specific backpropagated
  signals independent of the depth, we find that the parameter space’s local metric
  linearly depends on the depth even under the dynamical isometry. More precisely,
  we reveal that the conditional FIM’s spectrum concentrates around the maximum and
  the value grows linearly as the depth increases. To examine the spectrum, considering
  random initialization and the wide limit, we construct an algebraic methodology
  based on the free probability theory. As a byproduct, we provide an analysis of
  the solvable spectral distribution in two-hidden-layer cases. Lastly, experimental
  results verify that the appropriate learning rate for the online training of DNNs
  is in inverse proportional to depth, which is determined by the conditional FIM’s
  spectrum. "
