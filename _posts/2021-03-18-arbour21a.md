title: " Efficient Balanced Treatment Assignments for Experimentation "
abstract: " In this work, we address the problem of balanced treatment assignment
  for experiments by considering an interpretation of the problem as optimization
  of a two-sample test between test and control units. Using this lens we provide
  an assignment algorithm that is optimal with respect to the minimum spanning tree
  test of Friedman and Rafsky [1979]. This assignment to treatment groups may be performed
  exactly in polynomial time and allows for the design of experiments explicitly targeting
  the individual treatment effect. We provide a probabilistic interpretation of this
  process in terms of the most probable element of designs drawn from a determinantal
  point process. We provide a novel formulation of estimation as transductive inference
  and show how the tree structures used in design can also be used in an adjustment
  estimator. We conclude with a simulation study demonstrating the improved efficacy
  of our method. "
