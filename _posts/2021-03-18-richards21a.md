title: " Learning with Gradient Descent and Weakly Convex Losses "
abstract: " We study the learning performance of gradient descent when the empirical
  risk is weakly convex, namely, the smallest negative eigenvalue of the empirical
  risk’s Hessian is bounded in magnitude. By showing that this eigenvalue can control
  the stability of gradient descent, generalisation error bounds are proven that hold
  under a wider range of step sizes compared to previous work. Out of sample guarantees
  are then achieved by decomposing the test error into generalisation, optimisation
  and approximation errors, each of which can be bounded and traded off with respect
  to algorithmic parameters, sample size and magnitude of this eigenvalue. In the
  case of a two layer neural network, we demonstrate that the empirical risk can satisfy
  a notion of local weak convexity, specifically, the Hessian’s smallest eigenvalue
  during training can be controlled by the normalisation of the layers, i.e., network
  scaling. This allows test error guarantees to then be achieved when the population
  risk minimiser satisfies a complexity assumption. By trading off the network complexity
  and scaling, insights are gained into the implicit bias of neural network scaling,
  which are further supported by experimental findings. "
