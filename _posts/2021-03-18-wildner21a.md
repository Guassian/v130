title: " Moment-Based Variational Inference for Stochastic Differential Equations "
abstract: " Existing deterministic variational inference approaches for diffusion
  processes use simple proposals and target the marginal density of the posterior.
  We construct the variational process as a controlled version of the prior process
  and approximate the posterior by a set of moment functions. In combination with
  moment closure, the smoothing problem is reduced to a deterministic optimal control
  problem. Exploiting the path-wise Fisher information, we propose an optimization
  procedure that corresponds to a natural gradient descent in the variational parameters.
  Our approach allows for richer variational approximations that extend to state-dependent
  diffusion terms. The classical Gaussian process approximation is recovered as a
  special case. "
