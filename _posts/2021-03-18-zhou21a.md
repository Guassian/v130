title: " Curriculum Learning by Optimizing Learning Dynamics "
abstract: ' We study a novel curriculum learning scheme where in each round, samples
  are selected to achieve the greatest progress and fastest learning speed towards
  the ground-truth on all available samples. Inspired by an analysis of optimization
  dynamics under gradient flow for both regression and classification, the problem
  reduces to selecting training samples by a score computed from samplesâ€™ residual
  and linear temporal dynamics. It encourages the model to focus on the samples at
  learning frontier, i.e., those with large loss but fast learning speed. The scores
  in discrete time can be estimated via already-available byproducts of training,
  and thus require a negligible amount of extra computation. We discuss the properties
  and potential advantages of the proposed dynamics optimization via current deep
  learning theory and empirical study. By integrating it with cyclical training of
  neural networks, we introduce "dynamics-optimized curriculum learning (DoCL)", which
  selects the training set for each step by weighted sampling based on the scores.
  On nine different datasets, DoCL significantly outperforms random mini-batch SGD
  and recent curriculum learning methods both in terms of efficiency and final performance. '
