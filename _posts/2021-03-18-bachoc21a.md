title: " The Sample Complexity of Level Set Approximation "
abstract: " We study the problem of approximating the level set of an unknown function
  by sequentially querying its values. We introduce a family of algorithms called
  Bisect and Approximate through which we reduce the level set approximation problem
  to a local function approximation problem. We then show how this approach leads
  to rate-optimal sample complexity guarantees for H{รถ}lder functions, and we investigate
  how such rates improve when additional smoothness or other structural assumptions
  hold true. "
