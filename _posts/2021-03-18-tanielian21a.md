title: " Approximating Lipschitz continuous functions with GroupSort neural networks "
abstract: " Recent advances in adversarial attacks and Wasserstein GANs have advocated
  for use of neural networks with restricted Lipschitz constants. Motivated by these
  observations, we study the recently introduced GroupSort neural networks, with constraints
  on the weights, and make a theoretical step towards a better understanding of their
  expressive power. We show in particular how these networks can represent any Lipschitz
  continuous piecewise linear functions. We also prove that they are well-suited for
  approximating Lipschitz continuous functions and exhibit upper bounds on both the
  depth and size. To conclude, the efficiency of GroupSort networks compared with
  more standard ReLU networks is illustrated in a set of synthetic experiments. "
