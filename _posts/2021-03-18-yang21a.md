title: " Fully Gap-Dependent Bounds for Multinomial Logit Bandit "
abstract: " We study the multinomial logit (MNL) bandit problem, where at each time
  step, the seller offers an assortment of size at most $K$ from a pool of $N$ items,
  and the buyer purchases an item from the assortment according to a MNL choice model.
  The objective is to learn the model parameters and maximize the expected revenue.
  We present (i) an algorithm that identifies the optimal assortment $S^*$ within
  $\\widetilde{O}(\\sum_{i = 1}^N \\Delta_i^{-2})$ time steps with high probability,
  and (ii) an algorithm that incurs $O(\\sum_{i \\notin S^*} K\\Delta_i^{-1} \\log
  T)$ regret in $T$ time steps. To our knowledge, our algorithms are the \\emph{first}
  to achieve gap-dependent bounds that \\emph{fully} depends on the suboptimality
  gaps of \\emph{all} items. Our technical contributions include an algorithmic framework
  that relates the MNL-bandit problem to a variant of the top-$K$ arm identification
  problem in multi-armed bandits, a generalized epoch-based offering procedure, and
  a layer-based adaptive estimation procedure. "
