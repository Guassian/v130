title: " Predictive Complexity Priors "
abstract: " Specifying a Bayesian prior is notoriously difficult for complex models
  such as neural networks. Reasoning about parameters is made challenging by the high-dimensionality
  and over-parameterization of the space. Priors that seem benign and uninformative
  can have unintuitive and detrimental effects on a model’s predictions. For this
  reason, we propose predictive complexity priors: a functional prior that is defined
  by comparing the model’s predictions to those of a reference model. Although originally
  defined on the model outputs, we transfer the prior to the model parameters via
  a change of variables. The traditional Bayesian workflow can then proceed as usual.
  We apply our predictive complexity prior to high-dimensional regression, reasoning
  over neural network depth, and sharing of statistical strength for few-shot learning. "
