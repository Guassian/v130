title: " SONIA: A Symmetric Blockwise Truncated Optimization Algorithm "
abstract: " This work presents a new optimization algorithm for empirical risk minimization.
  The algorithm bridges the gap between first- and second-order methods by computing
  a search direction that uses a second-order-type update in one subspace, coupled
  with a scaled steepest descent step in the orthogonal complement. To this end, partial
  curvature information is incorporated to help with ill-conditioning, while simultaneously
  allowing the algorithm to scale to the large problem dimensions often encountered
  in machine learning applications. Theoretical results are presented to confirm that
  the algorithm converges to a stationary point in both the strongly convex and nonconvex
  cases. A stochastic variant of the algorithm is also presented, along with corresponding
  theoretical guarantees. Numerical results confirm the strengths of the new approach
  on standard machine learning problems. "
