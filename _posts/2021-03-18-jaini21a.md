title: " Sampling in Combinatorial Spaces with SurVAE Flow Augmented MCMC "
abstract: " Hybrid Monte Carlo is a powerful Markov Chain Monte Carlo method for sampling
  from complex continuous distributions. However, a major limitation of HMC is its
  inability to be applied to discrete domains due to the lack of gradient signal.
  In this work, we introduce a new approach based on augmenting monte carlo methods
  with SurVAE Flow to sample from discrete distributions using a combination of neural
  transport methods like normalizing flows, variational dequantization, and the Metropolis-Hastings
  rule. Our method first learns a continuous embedding of the discrete space using
  a surjective map and subsequently learns a bijective transformation from the continuous
  space to an approximately Gaussian distributed latent variable. Sampling proceeds
  by simulating MCMC chains in the latent space and mapping these samples to the target
  discrete space via the learned transformations. We demonstrate the efficacy of our
  algorithm on a range of examples from statistics, computational physics, and, machine
  learning, and observe improvements compared to alternative algorithms. "
