title: " Semi-Supervised Learning with Meta-Gradient "
abstract: " In this work, we propose a simple yet effective meta-learning algorithm
  in semi-supervised learning. We notice that most existing consistency-based approaches
  suffer from overfitting and limited model generalization ability, especially when
  training with only a small number of labeled data. To alleviate this issue, we propose
  a learn-to-generalize regularization term by utilizing the label information and
  optimize the problem in a meta-learning fashion. Specifically, we seek the pseudo
  labels of the unlabeled data so that the model can generalize well on the labeled
  data, which is formulated as a nested optimization problem. We address this problem
  using the meta-gradient that bridges between the pseudo label and the regularization
  term. In addition, we introduce a simple first-order approximation to avoid computing
  higher-order derivatives and provide theoretic convergence analysis. Extensive evaluations
  on the SVHN, CIFAR, and ImageNet datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm
  performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods. "
