title: " Transforming  Gaussian Processes With Normalizing Flows "
abstract: " Gaussian Processes (GP) can be used as flexible, non-parametric function
  priors. Inspired by the growing body of work on Normalizing Flows, we enlarge this
  class of priors through a parametric invertible transformation that can be made
  input-dependent. Doing so also allows us to encode interpretable prior knowledge
  (e.g., boundedness constraints). We derive a variational approximation to the resulting
  Bayesian inference problem, which is as fast as stochastic variational GP regression
  (Hensman et al., 2013; Dezfouli and Bonilla, 2015). This makes the model a computationally
  efficient alternative to other hierarchical extensions of GP priors (L{á}zaro-Gredilla,2012;
  Damianou and Lawrence,2013). The resulting algorithm’s computational and inferential
  performance is excellent, and we demonstrate this on a range of data sets. For example,
  even with only 5 inducing points and an input-dependent flow, our method is consistently
  competitive with a standard sparse GP fitted using 100 inducing points. "
