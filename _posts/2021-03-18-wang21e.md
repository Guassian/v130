title: " Multitask Bandit Learning Through Heterogeneous Feedback Aggregation "
abstract: " In many real-world applications, multiple agents seek to learn how to
  perform highly related yet slightly different tasks in an online bandit learning
  protocol. We formulate this problem as the $\\epsilon$-multi-player multi-armed
  bandit problem, in which a set of players concurrently interact with a set of arms,
  and for each arm, the reward distributions for all players are similar but not necessarily
  identical. We develop an upper confidence bound-based algorithm, RobustAgg($\\epsilon$),
  that adaptively aggregates rewards collected by different players. In the setting
  where an upper bound on the pairwise dissimilarities of reward distributions between
  players is known, we achieve instance-dependent regret guarantees that depend on
  the amenability of information sharing across players. We complement these upper
  bounds with nearly matching lower bounds. In the setting where pairwise dissimilarities
  are unknown, we provide a lower bound, as well as an algorithm that trades off minimax
  regret guarantees for adaptivity to unknown similarity structure. "
