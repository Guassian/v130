title: " Multi-Fidelity High-Order Gaussian Processes for Physical Simulation "
abstract: " The key task of physical simulation is to solve partial differential equations
  (PDEs) on discretized domains, which is known to be costly. In particular, high-fidelity
  solutions are much more expensive than low-fidelity ones. To reduce the cost, we
  consider novel Gaussian process (GP) models that leverage simulation examples of
  different fidelities to predict high-dimensional PDE solution outputs. Existing
  GP methods are either not scalable to high-dimensional outputs or lack effective
  strategies to integrate multi-fidelity examples. To address these issues, we propose
  Multi-Fidelity High-Order Gaussian Process (MFHoGP) that can capture complex correlations
  both between the outputs and between the fidelities to enhance solution estimation,
  and scale to large numbers of outputs. Based on a novel nonlinear coregionalization
  model, MFHoGP propagates bases throughout fidelities to fuse information, and places
  a deep matrix GP prior over the basis weights to capture the (nonlinear) relationships
  across the fidelities. To improve inference efficiency and quality, we use bases
  decomposition to largely reduce the model parameters, and layer-wise matrix Gaussian
  posteriors to capture the posterior dependency and to simplify the computation.
  Our stochastic variational learning algorithm successfully handles millions of outputs
  without extra sparse approximations. We show the advantages of our method in several
  typical applications. "
