title: " Feedback Coding for Active Learning "
abstract: " The iterative selection of examples for labeling in active machine learning
  is conceptually similar to feedback channel coding in information theory: in both
  tasks, the objective is to seek a minimal sequence of actions to encode information
  in the presence of noise. While this high-level overlap has been previously noted,
  there remain open questions on how to best formulate active learning as a communications
  system to leverage existing analysis and algorithms in feedback coding. In this
  work, we formally identify and leverage the structural commonalities between the
  two problems, including the characterization of encoder and noisy channel components,
  to design a new algorithm. Specifically, we develop an optimal transport-based feedback
  coding scheme called Approximate Posterior Matching (APM) for the task of active
  example selection and explore its application to Bayesian logistic regression, a
  popular model in active learning. We evaluate APM on a variety of datasets and demonstrate
  learning performance comparable to existing active learning methods, at a reduced
  computational cost. These results demonstrate the potential of directly deploying
  concepts from feedback channel coding to design efficient active learning strategies. "
