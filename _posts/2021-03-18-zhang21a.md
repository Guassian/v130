title: " Generalization Bounds for Stochastic Saddle Point Problems "
abstract: " This paper studies the generalization bounds for the empirical saddle
  point (ESP) solution to stochastic saddle point (SSP) problems. For SSP with Lipschitz
  continuous and strongly convex-strongly concave objective functions, we establish
  an {\\footnotesize$\\cO\\left(1/n\\right)$} generalization bound by using a probabilistic
  stability argument. We also provide generalization bounds under a variety of assumptions,
  including the cases without strong convexity and without bounded domains. We illustrate
  our results in three examples: batch policy learning in Markov decision process,
  stochastic composite optimization problem, and mixed strategy Nash equilibrium estimation
  for stochastic games. In each of these examples, we show that a regularized ESP
  solution enjoys a near-optimal sample complexity. To the best of our knowledge,
  this is the first set of results on the generalization theory of ESP. "
