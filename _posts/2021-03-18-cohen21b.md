title: " Differentially Private Weighted Sampling "
abstract: " Common datasets have the form of elements with keys (e.g., transactions
  and products) and the goal is to perform analytics on the aggregated form of key
  and frequency pairs. A weighted sample of keys by (a function of) frequency is a
  highly versatile summary that provides a sparse set of representative keys and supports
  approximate evaluations of query statistics. We propose private weighted sampling
  (PWS): A method that sanitizes a weighted sample as to ensure element-level differential
  privacy, while retaining its utility to the maximum extent possible. PWS maximizes
  the reporting probabilities of keys and estimation quality of a broad family of
  statistics. PWS improves over the state of the art even for the well-studied special
  case of private histograms, when no sampling is performed. We empirically observe
  significant performance gains of 20%-300% increase in key reporting for common Zipfian
  frequency distributions and accurate estimation with x2-8 lower frequencies. PWS
  is applied as a post-processing of a non-private sample, without requiring the original
  data. Therefore, it can be a seamless addition to existing implementations, such
  as those optimizes for distributed or streamed data. We believe that due to practicality
  and performance, PWS may become a method of choice in applications where privacy
  is desired. "
