title: " A Linearly Convergent Algorithm for Decentralized Optimization: Sending Less
  Bits for Free! "
abstract: " Decentralized optimization methods enable on-device training of machine
  learning models without a central coordinator. In many scenarios communication between
  devices is energy demanding and time consuming and forms the bottleneck of the entire
  system. We propose a new randomized first-order method which tackles the communication
  bottleneck by applying randomized compression operators to the communicated messages.
  By combining our scheme with a new variance reduction technique that progressively
  throughout the iterations reduces the adverse effect of the injected quantization
  noise, we obtain a scheme that converges linearly on strongly convex decentralized
  problems while using compressed communication only. We prove that our method can
  solve the problems without any increase in the number of communications compared
  to the baseline which does not perform any communication compression while still
  allowing for a significant compression factor which depends on the conditioning
  of the problem and the topology of the network. We confirm our theoretical findings
  in numerical experiments. "
