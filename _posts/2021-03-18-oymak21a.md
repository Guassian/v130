title: " A Theoretical Characterization of Semi-supervised Learning with Self-training
  for Gaussian Mixture Models "
abstract: " Self-training is a classical approach in semi-supervised learning which
  is successfully applied to a variety of machine learning problems. Self-training
  algorithms generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled examples and progressively refine
  these pseudo-labels which hopefully coincides with the actual labels. This work
  provides theoretical insights into self-training algorithms with a focus on linear
  classifiers. First, we provide a sample complexity analysis for Gaussian mixture
  models with two components. This is established by sharp non-asymptotic characterization
  of the self-training iterations which captures the evolution of the model accuracy
  in terms of a fixed-point iteration. Our analysis reveals the provable benefits
  of rejecting samples with low confidence and demonstrates how self-training iterations
  can gracefully improve the model accuracy. Secondly, we study a generalized GMM
  where the component means follow a distribution. We demonstrate that ridge regularization
  and class margin (i.e. separation between the component means) is crucial for the
  success and lack of regularization may prevent self-training from identifying the
  core features in the data. "
