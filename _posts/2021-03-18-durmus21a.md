title: " On Riemannian Stochastic Approximation Schemes with Fixed Step-Size "
abstract: " This paper studies fixed step-size stochastic approximation (SA) schemes,
  including stochastic gradient schemes, in a Riemannian framework. It is motivated
  by several applications, where geodesics can be computed explicitly, and their use
  accelerates crude Euclidean methods. A fixed step-size scheme defines a family of
  time-homogeneous Markov chains, parametrized by the step-size. Here, using this
  formulation, non-asymptotic performance bounds are derived, under Lyapunov conditions.
  Then, for any step-size, the corresponding Markov chain is proved to admit a unique
  stationary distribution, and to be geometrically ergodic. This result gives rise
  to a family of stationary distributions indexed by the step-size, which is further
  shown to converge to a Dirac measure, concentrated at the solution of the problem
  at hand, as the step-size goes to $0$. Finally, the asymptotic rate of this convergence
  is established, through an asymptotic expansion of the bias, and a central limit
  theorem. "
