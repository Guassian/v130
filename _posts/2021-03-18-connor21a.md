title: " Variational Autoencoder with Learned Latent Structure "
abstract: " The manifold hypothesis states that high-dimensional data can be modeled
  as lying on or near a low-dimensional, nonlinear manifold. Variational Autoencoders
  (VAEs) approximate this manifold by learning mappings from low-dimensional latent
  vectors to high-dimensional data while encouraging a global structure in the latent
  space through the use of a specified prior distribution. When this prior does not
  match the structure of the true data manifold, it can lead to a less accurate model
  of the data. To resolve this mismatch, we introduce the Variational Autoencoder
  with Learned Latent Structure (VAELLS) which incorporates a learnable manifold model
  into the latent space of a VAE. This enables us to learn the nonlinear manifold
  structure from the data and use that structure to define a prior in the latent space.
  The integration of a latent manifold model not only ensures that our prior is well-matched
  to the data, but also allows us to define generative transformation paths in the
  latent space and describe class manifolds with transformations stemming from examples
  of each class. We validate our model on examples with known latent structure and
  also demonstrate its capabilities on a real-world dataset. "
