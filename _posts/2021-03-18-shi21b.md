title: " A Deterministic Streaming Sketch for Ridge Regression "
abstract: " We provide a deterministic space-efficient algorithm for estimating ridge
  regression. For n data points with d features and a large enough regularization
  parameter, we provide a solution within eps L_2 error using only O(d/eps) space.
  This is the first o(d^2) space deterministic streaming algorithm with guaranteed
  solution error and risk bound for this classic problem. The algorithm sketches the
  covariance matrix by variants of Frequent Directions, which implies it can operate
  in insertion-only streams and a variety of distributed data settings. In comparisons
  to randomized sketching algorithms on synthetic and real-world datasets, our algorithm
  has less empirical error using less space and similar time. "
