title: " Principal Subspace Estimation Under Information Diffusion "
abstract: " Let $\\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{L}_0 + \\mathbf{S}_0$, where $\\mathbf{L}_0
  \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d\\times d}$ is low rank and $\\mathbf{S}_0$ is a perturbation
  matrix. We study the principal subspace estimation of $\\mathbf{L}_0$ through observations
  $\\mathbf{y}_j = f(\\mathbf{A})\\mathbf{x}_j$, $j=1,…,n$, where $f:\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow
  \\mathbb{R}$ is an unknown polynomial and $\\mathbf{x}_j$’s are i.i.d. random input
  signals. Such models are widely used in graph signal processing to model information
  diffusion dynamics over networks with applications in network topology inference
  and data analysis. We develop an estimation procedure based on nuclear norm penalization,
  and establish upper bounds on the principal subspace estimation error when $\\mathbf{A}$
  is the adjacency matrix of a random graph generated by $\\mathbf{L}_0$. Our theory
  shows that when the signal strength is strong enough, the exact rank of $\\mathbf{L}_0$
  can be recovered. By applying our results to blind community detection, we show
  that consistency of spectral clustering can be achieved for some popular stochastic
  block models. Together with the experimental results, our theory show that there
  is a fundamental limit of using the principal components obtained from diffused
  graph signals which is commonly adapted in current practice. Finally, under some
  structured perturbation $\\mathbf{S}_0$, we build the connection between this model
  with spiked covariance model and develop a new estimation procedure. We show that
  such estimators can be optimal under the minimax paradigm. "
