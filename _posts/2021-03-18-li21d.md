title: " Rate-improved inexact augmented Lagrangian method for constrained nonconvex
  optimization "
abstract: " First-order methods have been studied for nonlinear constrained optimization
  within the framework of the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) or penalty method.
  We propose an improved inexact ALM (iALM) and conduct a unified analysis for nonconvex
  problems with either convex or nonconvex constraints. Under certain regularity conditions
  (that are also assumed by existing works), we show an $\\tilde{O}(\\varepsilon^{-\\frac{5}{2}})$
  complexity result for a problem with a nonconvex objective and convex constraints
  and an $\\tilde{O}(\\varepsilon^{-3})$ complexity result for a problem with a nonconvex
  objective and nonconvex constraints, where the complexity is measured by the number
  of first-order oracles to yield an $\\varepsilon$-KKT solution. Both results are
  the best known. The same-order complexity results have been achieved by penalty
  methods. However, two different analysis techniques are used to obtain the results,
  and more importantly, the penalty methods generally perform significantly worse
  than iALM in practice. Our improved iALM and analysis close the gap between theory
  and practice. Numerical experiments on nonconvex problems with convex or nonconvex
  constraints are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. "
