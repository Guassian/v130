title: " Sample efficient learning of image-based diagnostic classifiers via probabilistic
  labels "
abstract: " Deep learning approaches often require huge datasets to achieve good generalization.
  This complicates its use in tasks like image-based medical diagnosis, where the
  small training datasets are usually insufficient to learn appropriate data representations.
  For such sensitive tasks it is also important to provide the confidence in the predictions.
  Here, we propose a way to learn and use probabilistic labels to train accurate and
  calibrated deep networks from relatively small datasets. We observe gains of up
  to 22% in the accuracy of models trained with these labels, as compared with traditional
  approaches, in three classification tasks: diagnosis of hip dysplasia, fatty liver,
  and glaucoma. The outputs of models trained with probabilistic labels are calibrated,
  allowing the interpretation of its predictions as proper probabilities. We anticipate
  this approach will apply to other tasks where few training instances are available
  and expert knowledge can be encoded as probabilities. "
