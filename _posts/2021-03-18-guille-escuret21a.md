title: " A Study of Condition Numbers for First-Order Optimization "
abstract: " In this work we introduce a new framework for the theoretical study of
  convergence and tuning of first-order optimization algorithms (FOA). The study of
  such algorithms typically requires assumptions on the objective functions: the most
  popular ones are probably smoothness and strong convexity. These metrics are used
  to tune the hyperparameters of FOA. We introduce a class of perturbations quantified
  via a new norm, called *-norm. We show that adding a small perturbation to the objective
  function has an equivalently small impact on the behavior of any FOA, which suggests
  that it should have a minor impact on the tuning of the algorithm. However, we show
  that smoothness and strong convexity can be heavily impacted by arbitrarily small
  perturbations, leading to excessively conservative tunings and convergence issues.
  In view of these observations, we propose a notion of continuity of the metrics,
  which is essential for a robust tuning strategy. Since smoothness and strong convexity
  are not continuous, we propose a comprehensive study of existing alternative metrics
  which we prove to be continuous. We describe their mutual relations and provide
  their guaranteed convergence rates for the Gradient Descent algorithm accordingly
  tuned. Finally we discuss how our work impacts the theoretical understanding of
  FOA and their performances. "
