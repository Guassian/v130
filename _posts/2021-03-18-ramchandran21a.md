title: " Latent Gaussian process with composite likelihoods and numerical quadrature "
abstract: " Clinical patient records are an example of high-dimensional data that
  is typically collected from disparate sources and comprises of multiple likelihoods
  with noisy as well as missing values. In this work, we propose an unsupervised generative
  model that can learn a low-dimensional representation among the observations in
  a latent space, while making use of all available data in a heterogeneous data setting
  with missing values. We improve upon the existing Gaussian process latent variable
  model (GPLVM) by incorporating multiple likelihoods and deep neural network parameterised
  back-constraints to create a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique for heterogeneous
  data. In addition, we develop a variational inference method for our model that
  uses numerical quadrature. We establish the effectiveness of our model and compare
  against existing GPLVM methods on a standard benchmark dataset as well as on clinical
  data of Parkinson’s disease patients treated at the HUS Helsinki University Hospital. "
