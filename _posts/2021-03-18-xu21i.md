title: " Couplings for Multinomial Hamiltonian Monte Carlo "
abstract: " Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a popular sampling method in Bayesian
  inference. Recently, Heng & Jacob (2019) studied Metropolis HMC with couplings for
  unbiased Monte Carlo estimation, establishing a generic parallelizable scheme for
  HMC. However, in practice a different HMC method, multinomial HMC, is considered
  as the go-to method, e.g. as part of the no-U-turn sampler. In multinomial HMC,
  proposed states are not limited to end-points as in Metropolis HMC; instead points
  along the entire trajectory can be proposed. In this paper, we establish couplings
  for multinomial HMC, based on optimal transport for multinomial sampling in its
  transition. We prove an upper bound for the meeting time – the time it takes for
  the coupled chains to meet – based on the notion of local contractivity. We evaluate
  our methods using three targets: 1,000 dimensional Gaussians, logistic regression
  and log-Gaussian Cox point processes. Compared to Heng & Jacob (2019), coupled multinomial
  HMC generally attains a smaller meeting time, and is more robust to choices of step
  sizes and trajectory lengths, which allows re-use of existing adaptation methods
  for HMC. These improvements together paves the way for a wider and more practical
  use of coupled HMC methods. "
