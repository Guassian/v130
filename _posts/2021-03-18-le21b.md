title: " Flow-based Alignment Approaches for Probability Measures in Different Spaces "
abstract: " Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) is a powerful tool to compare probability measures
  whose supports are in different metric spaces. However, GW suffers from a computational
  drawback since it requires to solve a complex non-convex quadratic program. In this
  work, we consider a specific family of cost metrics, namely, tree metrics for supports
  of each probability measure, to develop efficient and scalable discrepancies between
  the probability measures. Leveraging a tree structure, we propose to align flows
  from a root to each support instead of pair-wise tree metrics of supports, i.e.,
  flows from a support to another support, in GW. Consequently, we propose a novel
  discrepancy, named Flow-based Alignment (FlowAlign), by matching the flows of the
  probability measures. FlowAlign is computationally fast and scalable for large-scale
  applications. Further exploring the tree structure, we propose a variant of FlowAlign,
  named Depth-based Alignment (DepthAlign), by aligning the flows hierarchically along
  each depth level of the tree structures. Theoretically, we prove that both FlowAlign
  and DepthAlign are pseudo-metrics. We also derive tree-sliced variants of the proposed
  discrepancies for applications without prior knowledge about tree structures for
  probability measures, computed by averaging FlowAlign/DepthAlign using random tree
  metrics, adaptively sampled from supports of probability measures. Empirically,
  we test our proposed approaches against other variants of GW baselines on a few
  benchmark tasks. "
