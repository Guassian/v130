title: " Asymptotics of Ridge(less) Regression under General Source Condition "
abstract: " We analyze the prediction error of ridge regression in an asymptotic regime
  where the sample size and dimension go to infinity at a proportional rate. In particular,
  we consider the role played by the structure of the true regression parameter. We
  observe that the case of a general deterministic parameter can be reduced to the
  case of a random parameter from a structured prior. The latter assumption is a natural
  adaptation of classic smoothness assumptions in nonparametric regression, which
  are known as source conditions in the the context of regularization theory for inverse
  problems. Roughly speaking, we assume the large coefficients of the parameter are
  in correspondence to the principal components. In this setting a precise characterisation
  of the test error is obtained, depending on the inputs covariance and regression
  parameter structure. We illustrate this characterisation in a simplified setting
  to investigate the influence of the true parameter on optimal regularisation for
  overparameterized models. We show that interpolation (no regularisation) can be
  optimal even with bounded signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), provided that the parameter
  coefficients are larger on high-variance directions of the data, corresponding to
  a more regular function than posited by the regularization term. This contrasts
  with previous work considering ridge regression with isotropic prior, in which case
  interpolation is only optimal in the limit of infinite SNR. "
