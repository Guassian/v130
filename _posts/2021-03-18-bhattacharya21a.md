title: " Differentiable Causal Discovery Under Unmeasured Confounding "
abstract: " The data drawn from biological, economic, and social systems are often
  confounded due to the presence of unmeasured variables. Prior work in causal discovery
  has focused on discrete search procedures for selecting acyclic directed mixed graphs
  (ADMGs), specifically ancestral ADMGs, that encode ordinary conditional independence
  constraints among the observed variables of the system. However, confounded systems
  also exhibit more general equality restrictions that cannot be represented via these
  graphs, placing a limit on the kinds of structures that can be learned using ancestral
  ADMGs. In this work, we derive differentiable algebraic constraints that fully characterize
  the space of ancestral ADMGs, as well as more general classes of ADMGs, arid ADMGs
  and bow-free ADMGs, that capture all equality restrictions on the observed variables.
  We use these constraints to cast causal discovery as a continuous optimization problem
  and design differentiable procedures to find the best fitting ADMG when the data
  comes from a confounded linear system of equations with correlated errors. We demonstrate
  the efficacy of our method through simulations and application to a protein expression
  dataset. Code implementing our methods is open-source and publicly available at
  https://gitlab.com/rbhatta8/dcd and will be incorporated into the Ananke package. "
