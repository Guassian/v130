title: " Robust Mean Estimation on Highly Incomplete Data with Arbitrary Outliers "
abstract: " We study the problem of robustly estimating the mean of a $d$-dimensional
  distribution given $N$ examples, where most coordinates of every example may be
  missing and $\\varepsilon N$ examples may be arbitrarily corrupted. Assuming each
  coordinate appears in a constant factor more than $\\varepsilon N$ examples, we
  show algorithms that estimate the mean of the distribution with information-theoretically
  optimal dimension-independent error guarantees in nearly-linear time $\\widetilde
  O(Nd)$. Our results extend recent work on computationally-efficient robust estimation
  to a more widely applicable incomplete-data setting. "
