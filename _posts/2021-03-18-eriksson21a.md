title: " Scalable Constrained Bayesian Optimization "
abstract: " The global optimization of a high-dimensional black-box function under
  black-box constraints is a pervasive task in machine learning, control, and engineering.
  These problems are challenging since the feasible set is typically non-convex and
  hard to find, in addition to the curses of dimensionality and the heterogeneity
  of the underlying functions. In particular, these characteristics dramatically impact
  the performance of Bayesian optimization methods, that otherwise have become the
  defacto standard for sample-efficient optimization in unconstrained settings, leaving
  practitioners with evolutionary strategies or heuristics. We propose the scalable
  constrained Bayesian optimization (SCBO) algorithm that overcomes the above challenges
  and pushes the applicability of Bayesian optimization far beyond the state-of-the-art.
  A comprehensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that SCBO achieves excellent
  results on a variety of benchmarks. To this end, we propose two new control problems
  that we expect to be of independent value for the scientific community. "
