title: " DAG-Structured Clustering by Nearest Neighbors "
abstract: " Hierarchical clusterings compactly encode multiple granularities of clusters
  within a tree structure. Hierarchies, by definition, fail to capture different flat
  partitions that are not subsumed in one another. In this paper, we advocate for
  an alternative structure for representing multiple clusterings, a directed acyclic
  graph (DAG). By allowing nodes to have multiple parents, DAG structures are not
  only more flexible than trees, but also allow for points to be members of multiple
  clusters. We describe a scalable algorithm, Llama, which simply merges nearest neighbor
  substructures to form a DAG structure. Llama discovers structures that are more
  accurate than state-of-the-art tree-based techniques while remaining scalable to
  large-scale clustering benchmarks. Additionally, we support the proposed algorithm
  with theoretical guarantees on separated data, including types of data that cannot
  be correctly clustered by tree-based algorithms. "
