title: " Learning Partially Known Stochastic Dynamics with Empirical PAC Bayes "
abstract: " Neural Stochastic Differential Equations model a dynamical environment
  with neural nets assigned to their drift and diffusion terms. The high expressive
  power of their nonlinearity comes at the expense of instability in the identification
  of the large set of free parameters. This paper presents a recipe to improve the
  prediction accuracy of such models in three steps: i) accounting for epistemic uncertainty
  by assuming probabilistic weights, ii) incorporation of partial knowledge on the
  state dynamics, and iii) training the resultant hybrid model by an objective derived
  from a PAC-Bayesian generalization bound. We observe in our experiments that this
  recipe effectively translates partial and noisy prior knowledge into an improved
  model fit. "
