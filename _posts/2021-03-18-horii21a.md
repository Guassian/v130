title: " Bayesian Model Averaging for Causality Estimation and its Approximation based
  on Gaussian Scale Mixture Distributions "
abstract: " In estimation of the causal effect under linear Structural Causal Models
  (SCMs), it is common practice to first identify the causal structure, estimate the
  probability distributions, and then calculate the causal effect. However, if the
  goal is to estimate the causal effect, it is not necessary to fix a single causal
  structure or probability distributions. In this paper, we first show from a Bayesian
  perspective that it is Bayes optimal to weight (average) the causal effects estimated
  under each model rather than estimating a single model. This idea is also known
  as Bayesian model averaging. Although the Bayesian model averaging is optimal, as
  the number of candidate models increases, the weighting calculations become computationally
  hard. We develop an approximation to the Bayes optimal estimator by using Gaussian
  scale mixture distributions. "
