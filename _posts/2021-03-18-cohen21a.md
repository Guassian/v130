title: " Aligning Time Series on Incomparable Spaces "
abstract: " Dynamic time warping (DTW) is a useful method for aligning, comparing
  and combining time series, but it requires them to live in comparable spaces. In
  this work, we consider a setting in which time series live on different spaces without
  a sensible ground metric, causing DTW to become ill-defined. To alleviate this,
  we propose Gromov dynamic time warping (GDTW), a distance between time series on
  potentially incomparable spaces that avoids the comparability requirement by instead
  considering intra-relational geometry. We demonstrate its effectiveness at aligning,
  combining and comparing time series living on incomparable spaces. We further propose
  a smoothed version of GDTW as a differentiable loss and assess its properties in
  a variety of settings, including barycentric averaging, generative modeling and
  imitation learning. "
