title: " Implicit Regularization via Neural Feature Alignment "
abstract: " We approach the problem of implicit regularization in deep learning from
  a geometrical viewpoint. We highlight a regularization effect induced by a dynamical
  alignment ofthe neural tangent features introduced by Jacot et al. (2018), along
  a small number of task-relevant directions. This can be interpreted as a combined
  mechanism of feature selection and compression. By extrapolating a new analysis
  of Rademacher complexity bounds for linear models, we motivate and study a heuristic
  complexity measure that captures this phenomenon, in terms of sequences of tangent
  kernel classes along optimization paths. The code for our experiments is available
  as https://github.com/tfjgeorge/ntk_alignment. "
