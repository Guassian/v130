title: " The Unexpected Deterministic and Universal Behavior of Large Softmax Classifiers "
abstract: " This paper provides a large dimensional analysis of the Softmax classifier.
  We discover and prove that, when the classifier is trained on data satisfying loose
  statistical modeling assumptions, its weights become deterministic and solely depend
  on the data statistical means and covariances. As a striking consequence, despite
  the implicit and non-linear nature of the underlying optimization problem, the performance
  of the Softmax classifier is the same as if performed on a mere Gaussian mixture
  model, thereby disrupting the intuition that non-linearities inherently extract
  advanced statistical features from the data. Our findings are theoretically as well
  as numerically sustained on CNN representations of images produced by GANs. "
