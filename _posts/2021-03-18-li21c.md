title: " Unifying Clustered and Non-stationary Bandits "
abstract: " Non-stationary bandits and clustered bandits lift the restrictive assumptions
  in contextual bandits and provide solutions to many important real-world scenarios.
  Though they have been studied independently so far, we point out the essence in
  solving these two problems overlaps considerably. In this work, we connect these
  two strands of bandit research under the notion of test of homogeneity, which seamlessly
  addresses change detection for non-stationary bandit and cluster identification
  for clustered bandit in a unified solution framework. Rigorous regret analysis and
  extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate the value of our proposed solution,
  especially its flexibility in handling various environment assumptions, e.g., a
  clustered non-stationary environment. "
