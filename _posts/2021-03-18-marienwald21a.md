title: " High-Dimensional Multi-Task Averaging and Application to Kernel Mean Embedding "
abstract: " We propose an improved estimator for the multi-task averaging problem,
  whose goal is the joint estimation of the means of multiple distributions using
  separate, independent data sets. The naive approach is to take the empirical mean
  of each data set individually, whereas the proposed method exploits similarities
  between tasks, without any related information being known in advance. First, for
  each data set, similar or neighboring means are determined from the data by multiple
  testing. Then each naive estimator is shrunk towards the local average of its neighbors.
  We prove theoretically that this approach provides a reduction in mean squared error.
  This improvement can be significant when the dimension of the input space is large;
  demonstrating a “blessing of dimensionality” phenomenon. An application of this
  approach is the estimation of multiple kernel mean embeddings, which plays an important
  role in many modern applications. The theoretical results are verified on artificial
  and real world data. "
