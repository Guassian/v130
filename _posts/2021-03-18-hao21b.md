title: " Adaptive Approximate Policy Iteration "
abstract: " Model-free reinforcement learning algorithms combined with value function
  approximation have recently achieved impressive performance in a variety of application
  domains. However, the theoretical understanding of such algorithms is limited, and
  existing results are largely focused on episodic or discounted Markov decision processes
  (MDPs). In this work, we present adaptive approximate policy iteration (AAPI), a
  learning scheme which enjoys a O(T^{2/3}) regret bound for undiscounted, continuing
  learning in uniformly ergodic MDPs. This is an improvement over the best existing
  bound of O(T^{3/4}) for the average-reward case with function approximation. Our
  algorithm and analysis rely on online learning techniques, where value functions
  are treated as losses. The main technical novelty is the use of a data-dependent
  adaptive learning rate coupled with a so-called optimistic prediction of upcoming
  losses. In addition to theoretical guarantees, we demonstrate the advantages of
  our approach empirically on several environments. "
