title: " Mirrorless Mirror Descent: A Natural Derivation of Mirror Descent "
abstract: " We present a direct (primal only) derivation of Mirror Descent as a “partial”
  discretization of gradient flow on a Riemannian manifold where the metric tensor
  is the Hessian of the Mirror Descent potential function. We contrast this discretization
  to Natural Gradient Descent, which is obtained by a “full” forward Euler discretization.
  This view helps shed light on the relationship between the methods and allows generalizing
  Mirror Descent to any Riemannian geometry in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, even when the metric
  tensor is not a Hessian, and thus there is no “dual.” "
