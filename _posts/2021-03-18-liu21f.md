title: " Smooth Bandit Optimization: Generalization to Holder Space "
abstract: " We consider bandit optimization of a smooth reward function, where the
  goal is cumulative regret minimization. This problem has been studied for $\\alpha$-Holder
  continuous (including Lipschitz) functions with $0<\\alpha\\leq 1$. Our main result
  is in generalization of the reward function to Holder space with exponent $\\alpha>1$
  to bridge the gap between Lipschitz bandits and infinitely-differentiable models
  such as linear bandits. For Holder continuous functions, approaches based on random
  sampling in bins of a discretized domain suffices as optimal. In contrast, we propose
  a class of two-layer algorithms that deploy misspecified linear/polynomial bandit
  algorithms in bins. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can exploit higher-order
  smoothness of the function by deriving a regret upper bound of $\\tilde{O}(T^\\frac{d+\\alpha}{d+2\\alpha})$
  for when $\\alpha>1$, which matches existing lower bound. We also study adaptation
  to unknown function smoothness over a continuous scale of Holder spaces indexed
  by $\\alpha$, with a bandit model selection approach applied with our proposed two-layer
  algorithms. We show that it achieves regret rate that matches the existing lower
  bound for adaptation within the $\\alpha\\leq 1$ subset. "
