title: " Critical Parameters for Scalable Distributed Learning with Large Batches
  and Asynchronous Updates "
abstract: " It has been experimentally observed that the efficiency of distributed
  training with stochastic gradient (SGD) depends decisively on the batch size and—in
  asynchronous implementations—on the gradient staleness. Especially, it has been
  observed that the speedup saturates beyond a certain batch size and/or when the
  delays grow too large. We identify a data-dependent parameter that explains the
  speedup saturation in both these settings. Our comprehensive theoretical analysis,
  for strongly convex, convex and non-convex settings, unifies and generalized prior
  work directions that often focused on only one of these two aspects. In particular,
  our approach allows us to derive improved speedup results under frequently considered
  sparsity assumptions. Our insights give rise to theoretically based guidelines on
  how the learning rates can be adjusted in practice. We show that our results are
  tight and illustrate key findings in numerical experiments. "
