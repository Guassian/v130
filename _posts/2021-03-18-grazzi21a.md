title: " Convergence Properties of Stochastic Hypergradients "
abstract: " Bilevel optimization problems are receiving increasing attention in machine
  learning as they provide a natural framework for hyperparameter optimization and
  meta-learning. A key step to tackle these problems is the efficient computation
  of the gradient of the upper-level objective (hypergradient). In this work, we study
  stochastic approximation schemes for the hypergradient, which are important when
  the lower-level problem is empirical risk minimization on a large dataset. The method
  that we propose is a stochastic variant of the approximate implicit differentiation
  approach in (Pedregosa, 2016). We provide bounds for the mean square error of the
  hypergradient approximation, under the assumption that the lower-level problem is
  accessible only through a stochastic mapping which is a contraction in expectation.
  In particular, our main bound is agnostic to the choice of the two stochastic solvers
  employed by the procedure. We provide numerical experiments to support our theoretical
  analysis and to show the advantage of using stochastic hypergradients in practice. "
