title: " On Learning Continuous Pairwise Markov Random Fields "
abstract: " We consider learning a sparse pairwise Markov Random Field (MRF) with
  continuous-valued variables from i.i.d samples. We adapt the algorithm of Vuffray
  et al. (2019) to this setting and provide finite-sample analysis revealing sample
  complexity scaling logarithmically with the number of variables, as in the discrete
  and Gaussian settings. Our approach is applicable to a large class of pairwise MRFs
  with continuous variables and also has desirable asymptotic properties, including
  consistency and normality under mild conditions. Further, we establish that the
  population version of the optimization criterion employed in Vuffray et al. (2019)
  can be interpreted as local maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). As part of our
  analysis, we introduce a robust variation of sparse linear regression aâ€˜ la Lasso,
  which may be of interest in its own right. "
