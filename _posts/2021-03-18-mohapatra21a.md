title: " Hidden Cost of Randomized Smoothing "
abstract: " The fragility of modern machine learning models has drawn a considerable
  amount of attention from both academia and the public. While immense interests were
  in either crafting adversarial attacks as a way to measure the robustness of neural
  networks or devising worst-case analytical robustness verification with guarantees,
  few methods could enjoy both scalability and robustness guarantees at the same time.
  As an alternative to these attempts, randomized smoothing adopts a different prediction
  rule that enables statistical robustness arguments which easily scale to large networks.
  However, in this paper, we point out the side effects of current randomized smoothing
  workflows. Specifically, we articulate and prove two major points: 1) the decision
  boundaries of smoothed classifiers will shrink, resulting in disparity in class-wise
  accuracy; 2) applying noise augmentation in the training process does not necessarily
  resolve the shrinking issue due to the inconsistent learning objectives. "
