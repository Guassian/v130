title: " Exploiting Equality Constraints in Causal Inference "
abstract: " Assumptions about equality of effects are commonly made in causal inference
  tasks. For example, the well-known “difference-in-differences” method assumes that
  confounding remains constant across time periods. Similarly, it is not unreasonable
  to assume that causal effects apply equally to units undergoing interference. Finally,
  sensitivity analysis often hypothesizes equality among existing and unaccounted
  for confounders. Despite the ubiquity of these “equality constraints,” modern identification
  methods have not leveraged their presence in a systematic way. In this paper, we
  develop a novel graphical criterion that extends the well-known method of generalized
  instrumental sets to exploit such additional constraints for causal identification
  in linear models. We further demonstrate how it solves many diverse problems found
  in the literature in a general way, including difference-in-differences, interference,
  as well as benchmarking in sensitivity analysis. "
