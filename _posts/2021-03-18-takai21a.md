title: " On the number of linear functions composing deep neural network: Towards
  a refined definition of neural networks complexity "
abstract: " The classical approach to measure the expressive power of deep neural
  networks with piecewise linear activations is based on counting their maximum number
  of linear regions. This complexity measure is quite relevant to understand general
  properties of the expressivity of neural networks such as the benefit of depth over
  width. Nevertheless, it appears limited when it comes to comparing the expressivity
  of different network architectures. This lack becomes particularly prominent when
  considering permutation-invariant networks, due to the symmetrical redundancy among
  the linear regions. To tackle this, we propose a refined definition of piecewise
  linear function complexity: instead of counting the number of linear regions directly,
  we first introduce an equivalence relation among the linear functions composing
  a piecewise linear function and then count those linear functions relative to that
  equivalence relation. Our new complexity measure can clearly distinguish between
  the two aforementioned models, is consistent with the classical measure, and increases
  exponentially with depth. "
