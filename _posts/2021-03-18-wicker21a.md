title: " Bayesian Inference with Certifiable Adversarial Robustness "
abstract: " We consider adversarial training of deep neural networks through the lens
  of Bayesian learning and present a principled framework for adversarial training
  of Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) with certifiable guarantees. We rely on techniques
  from constraint relaxation of non-convex optimisation problems and modify the standard
  cross-entropy error model to enforce posterior robustness to worst-case perturbations
  in $\\epsilon-$balls around input points. We illustrate how the resulting framework
  can be combined with methods commonly employed for approximate inference of BNNs.
  In an empirical investigation, we demonstrate that the presented approach enables
  training of certifiably robust models on MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-10 and can
  also be beneficial for uncertainty calibration. Our method is the first to directly
  train certifiable BNNs, thus facilitating their deployment in safety-critical applications. "
