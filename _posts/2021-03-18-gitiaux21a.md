title: " Learning Smooth and Fair Representations "
abstract: " This paper explores the statistical properties of fair representation
  learning, a pre-processing method that preemptively removes the correlations between
  features and sensitive attributes by mapping features to a fair representation space.
  We show that the demographic parity of a representation can be certified from a
  finite sample if and only if the mapping guarantees that the chi-squared mutual
  information between features and representations is finite for distributions of
  the features. Empirically, we find that smoothing representations with an additive
  Gaussian white noise provides generalization guarantees of fairness certificates,
  which improves upon existing fair representation learning approaches. "
