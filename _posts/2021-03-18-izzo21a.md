title: " Approximate Data Deletion from Machine Learning Models "
abstract: " Deleting data from a trained machine learning (ML) model is a critical
  task in many applications. For example, we may want to remove the influence of training
  points that might be out of date or outliers. Regulations such as EUâ€™s General Data
  Protection Regulation also stipulate that individuals can request to have their
  data deleted. The naive approach to data deletion is to retrain the ML model on
  the remaining data, but this is too time consuming. In this work, we propose a new
  approximate deletion method for linear and logistic models whose computational cost
  is linear in the the feature dimension d and independent of the number of training
  data n. This is a significant gain over all existing methods, which all have superlinear
  time dependence on the dimension. We also develop a new feature-injection test to
  evaluate the thoroughness of data deletion from ML models. "
