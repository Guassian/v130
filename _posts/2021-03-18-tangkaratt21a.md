title: " Robust Imitation Learning from Noisy Demonstrations "
abstract: " Robust learning from noisy demonstrations is a practical but highly challenging
  problem in imitation learning. In this paper, we first theoretically show that robust
  imitation learning can be achieved by optimizing a classification risk with a symmetric
  loss. Based on this theoretical finding, we then propose a new imitation learning
  method that optimizes the classification risk by effectively combining pseudo-labeling
  with co-training. Unlike existing methods, our method does not require additional
  labels or strict assumptions about noise distributions. Experimental results on
  continuous-control benchmarks show that our method is more robust compared to state-of-the-art
  methods. "
