title: " A Scalable Gradient Free Method for Bayesian Experimental Design with Implicit
  Models "
abstract: " Bayesian experimental design (BED) is to answer the question that how
  to choose designs that maximize the information gathering. For implicit models,
  where the likelihood is intractable but sampling is possible, conventional BED methods
  have difficulties in efficiently estimating the posterior distribution and maximizing
  the mutual information (MI) between data and parameters. Recent work proposed the
  use of gradient ascent to maximize a lower bound on MI to deal with these issues.
  However, the approach requires a sampling path to compute the pathwise gradient
  of the MI lower bound with respect to the design variables, and such a pathwise
  gradient is usually inaccessible for implicit models. In this paper, we propose
  a novel approach that leverages recent advances in stochastic approximate gradient
  ascent incorporated with a smoothed variational MI estimator for efficient and robust
  BED. Without the necessity of pathwise gradients, our approach allows the design
  process to be achieved through a unified procedure with an approximate gradient
  for implicit models. Several experiments show that our approach outperforms baseline
  methods, and significantly improves the scalability of BED in high-dimensional problems "
