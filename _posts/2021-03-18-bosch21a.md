title: " Calibrated Adaptive Probabilistic ODE Solvers "
abstract: " Probabilistic solvers for ordinary differential equations assign a posterior
  measure to the solution of an initial value problem. The joint covariance of this
  distribution provides an estimate of the (global) approximation error. The contraction
  rate of this error estimate as a function of the solverâ€™s step-size identifies it
  as a well-calibrated worst-case error, but its explicit numerical value for a certain
  step size is not automatically a good estimate of the explicit error. Addressing
  this issue, we introduce, discuss, and assess several probabilistically motivated
  ways to calibrate the uncertainty estimate. Numerical experiments demonstrate that
  these calibration methods interact efficiently with adaptive step-size selection,
  resulting in descriptive, and efficiently computable posteriors. We demonstrate
  the efficiency of the methodology by benchmarking against the classic, widely used
  Dormand-Prince 4/5 Runge-Kutta method. "
