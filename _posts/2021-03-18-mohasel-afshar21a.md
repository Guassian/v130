title: " Non-Volume Preserving Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and No-U-TurnSamplers "
abstract: " Volume preservation is usually regarded as a necessary property for the
  leapfrog transition functions that are used in Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and
  No-U-Turn (NUTS) samplers to guarantee convergence to the target distribution. In
  this work we rigorously prove that with minimal algorithmic modifications, both
  HMC and NUTS can be combined with transition functions that are not necessarily
  volume preserving. In light of these results, we propose a non-volume preserving
  transition function that conserves the Hamiltonian better than the baseline leapfrog
  mechanism, on piecewise-continuous distributions. The resulting samplers do not
  require any assumptions on the geometry of the discontinuity boundaries, and our
  experimental results show a significant improvement upon traditional HMC and NUTS. "
