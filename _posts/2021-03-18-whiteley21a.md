title: " Inference in Stochastic Epidemic Models via Multinomial Approximations "
abstract: " We introduce a new method for inference in stochastic epidemic models
  which uses recursive multinomial approximations to integrate over unobserved variables
  and thus circumvent likelihood intractability. The method is applicable to a class
  of discrete-time, finite-population compartmental models with partial, randomly
  under-reported or missing count observations. In contrast to state-of-the-art alternatives
  such as Approximate Bayesian Computation techniques, no forward simulation of the
  model is required and there are no tuning parameters. Evaluating the approximate
  marginal likelihood of model parameters is achieved through a computationally simple
  filtering recursion. The accuracy of the approximation is demonstrated through analysis
  of real and simulated data using a model of the 1995 Ebola outbreak in the Democratic
  Republic of Congo. We show how the method can be embedded within a Sequential Monte
  Carlo approach to estimating the time-varying reproduction number of COVID-19 in
  Wuhan, China, recently published by Kucharski et al. (2020). "
