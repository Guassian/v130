title: " Minimal enumeration of all possible total effects in a Markov equivalence
  class "
abstract: " In observational studies, when a total causal effect of interest is not
  identified, the set of all possible effects can be reported instead. This typically
  occurs when the underlying causal DAG is only known up to a Markov equivalence class,
  or a refinement thereof due to background knowledge. As such, the class of possible
  causal DAGs is represented by a maximally oriented partially directed acyclic graph
  (MPDAG), which contains both directed and undirected edges. We characterize the
  minimal additional edge orientations required to identify a given total effect.
  A recursive algorithm is then developed to enumerate subclasses of DAGs, such that
  the total effect in each subclass is identified as a distinct functional of the
  observed distribution. This resolves an issue with existing methods, which often
  report possible total effects with duplicates, namely those that are numerically
  distinct due to sampling variability but are in fact causally identical. "
