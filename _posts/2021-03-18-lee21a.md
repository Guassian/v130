title: " A Variational Information Bottleneck Approach to Multi-Omics Data Integration "
abstract: " Integration of data from multiple omics techniques is becoming increasingly
  important in biomedical research. Due to non-uniformity and technical limitations
  in omics platforms, such integrative analyses on multiple omics, which we refer
  to as views, involve learning from incomplete observations with various view-missing
  patterns. This is challenging because i) complex interactions within and across
  observed views need to be properly addressed for optimal predictive power and ii)
  observations with various view-missing patterns need to be flexibly integrated.
  To address such challenges, we propose a deep variational information bottleneck
  (IB) approach for incomplete multi-view observations. Our method applies the IB
  framework on marginal and joint representations of the observed views to focus on
  intra-view and inter-view interactions that are relevant for the target. Most importantly,
  by modeling the joint representations as a product of marginal representations,
  we can efficiently learn from observed views with various view-missing patterns.
  Experiments on real-world datasets show that our method consistently achieves gain
  from data integration and outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks. "
