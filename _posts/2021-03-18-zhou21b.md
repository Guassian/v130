title: " Towards Understanding the Behaviors of Optimal Deep Active Learning Algorithms "
abstract: " Active learning (AL) algorithms may achieve better performance with fewer
  data because the model guides the data selection process. While many algorithms
  have been proposed, there is little study on what the optimal AL algorithm looks
  like, which would help researchers understand where their models fall short and
  iterate on the design. In this paper, we present a simulated annealing algorithm
  to search for this optimal oracle and analyze it for several tasks. We present qualitative
  and quantitative insights into the behaviors of this oracle, comparing and contrasting
  them with those of various heuristics. Moreover, we are able to consistently improve
  the heuristics using one particular insight. We hope that our findings can better
  inform future active learning research. The code is available at https://github.com/YilunZhou/optimal-active-learning. "
