title: " Efficient Methods for Structured Nonconvex-Nonconcave Min-Max Optimization "
abstract: " The use of min-max optimization in the adversarial training of deep neural
  network classifiers, and the training of generative adversarial networks has motivated
  the study of nonconvex-nonconcave optimization objectives, which frequently arise
  in these applications. Unfortunately, recent results have established that even
  approximate first-order stationary points of such objectives are intractable, even
  under smoothness conditions, motivating the study of min-max objectives with additional
  structure. We introduce a new class of structured nonconvex-nonconcave min-max optimization
  problems, proposing a generalization of the extragradient algorithm which provably
  converges to a stationary point. The algorithm applies not only to Euclidean spaces,
  but also to general $\\ell_p$-normed finite-dimensional real vector spaces. We also
  discuss its stability under stochastic oracles and provide bounds on its sample
  complexity. Our iteration complexity and sample complexity bounds either match or
  improve the best known bounds for the same or less general nonconvex-nonconcave
  settings, such as those that satisfy variational coherence or in which a weak solution
  to the associated variational inequality problem is assumed to exist. "
