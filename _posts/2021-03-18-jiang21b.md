title: " Learning the Truth From Only One Side of the Story "
abstract: " Learning under one-sided feedback (i.e., where we only observe the labels
  for examples we predicted positively on) is a fundamental problem in machine learning
  â€“ applications include lending and recommendation systems. Despite this, there has
  been surprisingly little progress made in ways to mitigate the effects of the sampling
  bias that arises. We focus on generalized linear models and show that without adjusting
  for this sampling bias, the model may converge suboptimally or even fail to converge
  to the optimal solution. We propose an adaptive approach that comes with theoretical
  guarantees and show that it outperforms several existing methods empirically. Our
  method leverages variance estimation techniques to efficiently learn under uncertainty,
  offering a more principled alternative compared to existing approaches. "
