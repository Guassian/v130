title: " Private optimization without constraint violations "
abstract: " We study the problem of differentially private optimization with linear
  constraints when the right-hand-side of the constraints depends on private data.
  This type of problem appears in many applications, especially resource allocation.
  Previous research provided solutions that retained privacy but sometimes violated
  the constraints. In many settings, however, the constraints cannot be violated under
  any circumstances. To address this hard requirement, we present an algorithm that
  releases a nearly-optimal solution satisfying the constraints with probability 1.
  We also prove a lower bound demonstrating that the difference between the objective
  value of our algorithmâ€™s solution and the optimal solution is tight up to logarithmic
  factors among all differentially private algorithms. We conclude with experiments
  demonstrating that our algorithm can achieve nearly optimal performance while preserving
  privacy. "
