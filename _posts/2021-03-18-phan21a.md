title: " Designing Transportable Experiments Under S-admissability "
abstract: " We consider the problem of designing a randomized experiment on a source
  population to estimate the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) on a target population.
  We propose a novel approach which explicitly considers the target when designing
  the experiment on the source. Under the covariate shift assumption, we design an
  unbiased importance-weighted estimator for the target populationâ€™s ATE. To reduce
  the variance of our estimator, we design a covariate balance condition (Target Balance)
  between the treatment and control groups based on the target population. We show
  that Target Balance achieves a higher variance reduction asymptotically than methods
  that do not consider the target population during the design phase. Our experiments
  illustrate that Target Balance reduces the variance even for small sample sizes. "
