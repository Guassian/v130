title: " Stability and Differential Privacy of Stochastic Gradient Descent for Pairwise
  Learning with Non-Smooth Loss "
abstract: " Pairwise learning has recently received increasing attention since it
  subsumes many important machine learning tasks (e.g. AUC maximization and metric
  learning) into a unifying framework. In this paper, we give the first-ever-known
  stability and generalization analysis of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for pairwise
  learning with non-smooth loss functions, which are widely used (e.g. Ranking SVM
  with the hinge loss). We introduce a novel decomposition in its stability analysis
  to decouple the pairwisely dependent random variables, and derive generalization
  bounds consistent with pointwise learning. Furthermore, we apply our stability analysis
  to develop differentially private SGD for pairwise learning, for which our utility
  bounds match with the state-of-the-art output perturbation method (Huai et al.,
  2020) with smooth losses. Finally, we illustrate the results using specific examples
  of AUC maximization and similarity metric learning. As a byproduct, we provide an
  affirmative solution to an open question on the advantage of the nuclear-norm constraint
  over Frobenius norm constraint in similarity metric learning. "
