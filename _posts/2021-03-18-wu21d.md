title: " Completing the Picture: Randomized Smoothing Suffers from the Curse of Dimensionality
  for a Large Family of Distributions "
abstract: " Randomized smoothing is currently the most competitive technique for providing
  provable robustness guarantees. Since this approach is model-agnostic and inherently
  scalable we can certify arbitrary classifiers. Despite its success, recent works
  show that for a small class of i.i.d. distributions, the largest $l_p$ radius that
  can be certified using randomized smoothing decreases as $O(1/d^{1/2-1/p})$ with
  dimension $d$ for $p > 2$. We complete the picture and show that similar no-go results
  hold for the $l_2$ norm for a much more general family of distributions which are
  continuous and symmetric about the origin. Specifically, we calculate two different
  upper bounds of the $l_2$ certified radius which have a constant multiplier of order
  $\\Theta(1/d^{1/2})$. Moreover, we extend our results to $l_p (p>2)$ certification
  with spherical symmetric distributions solidifying the limitations of randomized
  smoothing. We discuss the implications of our results for how accuracy and robustness
  are related, and why robust training with noise augmentation can alleviate some
  of the limitations in practice. We also show that on real-world data the gap between
  the certified radius and our upper bounds is small. "
