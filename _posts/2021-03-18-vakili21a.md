title: " On Information Gain and Regret Bounds in Gaussian Process Bandits "
abstract: " Consider the sequential optimization of an expensive to evaluate and possibly
  non-convex objective function $f$ from noisy feedback, that can be considered as
  a continuum-armed bandit problem. Upper bounds on the regret performance of several
  learning algorithms (GP-UCB, GP-TS, and their variants) are known under both a Bayesian
  (when $f$ is a sample from a Gaussian process (GP)) and a frequentist (when $f$
  lives in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space) setting. The regret bounds often rely
  on the maximal information gain $\\gamma_T$ between $T$ observations and the underlying
  GP (surrogate) model. We provide general bounds on $\\gamma_T$ based on the decay
  rate of the eigenvalues of the GP kernel, whose specialisation for commonly used
  kernels improves the existing bounds on $\\gamma_T$, and subsequently the regret
  bounds relying on $\\gamma_T$ under numerous settings. For the Mat{Ã©}rn family of
  kernels, where the lower bounds on $\\gamma_T$, and regret under the frequentist
  setting, are known, our results close a huge polynomial in $T$ gap between the upper
  and lower bounds (up to logarithmic in $T$ factors). "
