title: " Identification of Matrix Joint Block Diagonalization "
abstract: " Given a set $\\mathcal{C}=\\{C_i\\}_{i=1}^m$ of square matrices, the matrix
  blind joint block diagonalization problem (BJBDP) is to find a full column rank
  matrix $A$ such that $C_i=A\\Sigma_iA^{\\T}$ for all $i$, where $\\Sigma_i$’s are
  all block diagonal matrices with as many diagonal blocks as possible. The BJBDP
  plays an important role in independent subspace analysis. This paper considers the
  identification problem for BJBDP, that is, under what conditions and by what means,
  we can identify the diagonalizer $A$ and the block diagonal structure of $\\Sigma_i$,
  especially when there is noise in $C_i$’s. In this paper, we propose a “bi-block
  diagonalization” method to solve BJBDP, and establish sufficient conditions for
  when the method is able to accomplish the task. Numerical simulations validate our
  theoretical results. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, current numerical methods
  for BJBDP have no theoretical guarantees for the identification of the exact solution,
  whereas our method does. "
