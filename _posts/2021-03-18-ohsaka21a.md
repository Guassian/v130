title: " Unconstrained MAP Inference, Exponentiated Determinantal Point Processes,
  and Exponential Inapproximability "
abstract: " We study the computational complexity of two hard problems on determinantal
  point processes (DPPs). One is maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference, i.e., to find
  a principal submatrix having the maximum determinant. The other is probabilistic
  inference on exponentiated DPPs (E-DPPs), which can sharpen or weaken the diversity
  preference of DPPs with an exponent parameter $p$. We prove the following complexity-theoretic
  hardness results that explain the difficulty in approximating unconstrained MAP
  inference and the normalizing constant for E-DPPs. (1) Unconstrained MAP inference
  for an $n \\times n$ matrix is NP-hard to approximate within a $2^{\\beta n}$-factor,
  where $\\beta = 10^{-10^{13}}$. This result improves upon a $(9/8-\\epsilon)$-factor
  inapproximability given by Kulesza and Taskar (2012). (2) The normalizing constant
  for E-DPPs of any (fixed) constant exponent $p \\geq \\beta^{-1} = 10^{10^{13}}$
  is NP-hard to approximate within a $2^{\\beta pn}$-factor. This gives a(nother)
  negative answer to open questions posed by Kulesza and Taskar (2012); Ohsaka and
  Matsuoka (2020). "
