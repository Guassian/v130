title: " Benchmarking Simulation-Based Inference "
abstract: " Recent advances in probabilistic modelling have led to a large number
  of simulation-based inference algorithms which do not require numerical evaluation
  of likelihoods. However, a public benchmark with appropriate performance metrics
  for such ’likelihood-free’ algorithms has been lacking. This has made it difficult
  to compare algorithms and identify their strengths and weaknesses. We set out to
  fill this gap: We provide a benchmark with inference tasks and suitable performance
  metrics, with an initial selection of algorithms including recent approaches employing
  neural networks and classical Approximate Bayesian Computation methods. We found
  that the choice of performance metric is critical, that even state-of-the-art algorithms
  have substantial room for improvement, and that sequential estimation improves sample
  efficiency. Neural network-based approaches generally exhibit better performance,
  but there is no uniformly best algorithm. We provide practical advice and highlight
  the potential of the benchmark to diagnose problems and improve algorithms. The
  results can be explored interactively on a companion website. All code is open source,
  making it possible to contribute further benchmark tasks and inference algorithms. "
