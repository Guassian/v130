title: " Power of Hints for Online Learning with Movement Costs "
abstract: " We consider the online linear optimization problem with movement costs,
  a variant of online learning in which the learner must not only respond to cost
  vectors $c_t$ with points $x_t$ in order to maintain low regret, but is also penalized
  for movement by an additional cost $\\|x_t-x_{t+1}\\|^{1+\\epsilon}$ for some $\\epsilon>0$.
  Classically, simple algorithms that obtain the optimal $\\sqrt{T}$ regret already
  are very stable and do not incur a significant movement cost. However, recent work
  has shown that when the learning algorithm is provided with weak “hint” vectors
  that have a positive correlation with the costs, the regret can be significantly
  improved to $\\log(T)$. In this work, we study the stability of such algorithms,
  and provide matching upper and lower bounds showing that incorporating movement
  costs results in intricate tradeoffs between $\\log(T)$ when $\\epsilon\\ge 1$ and
  $\\sqrt{T}$ regret when $\\epsilon=0$. "
