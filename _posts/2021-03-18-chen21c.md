title: " Communication Efficient Primal-Dual Algorithm for Nonconvex Nonsmooth Distributed
  Optimization "
abstract: " Decentralized optimization problems frequently appear in the large scale
  machine learning problems. However, few works work on the difficult nonconvex nonsmooth
  case. In this paper, we propose a decentralized primal-dual algorithm to solve this
  type of problem in a decentralized manner and the proposed algorithm can achieve
  an $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\epsilon^2)$ iteration complexity to attain an $\\epsilon-$solution,
  which is the well-known lower iteration complexity bound for nonconvex optimization.
  To our knowledge, it is the first algorithm achieving this rate under a nonconvex,
  nonsmooth decentralized setting. Furthermore, to reduce communication overhead,
  we also modifying our algorithm by compressing the vectors exchanged between agents.
  The iteration complexity of the algorithm with compression is still $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\epsilon^2)$.
  Besides, we apply the proposed algorithm to solve nonconvex linear regression problem
  and train deep learning model, both of which demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy
  of the proposed algorithm. "
