title: " On the Memory Mechanism of Tensor-Power Recurrent Models "
abstract: " Tensor-power (TP) recurrent model is a family of non-linear dynamical
  systems, of which the recurrence relation consists of a p-fold (a.k.a., degree-p)
  tensor product. Despite such the model frequently appears in the advanced recurrent
  neural networks (RNNs), to this date there is limited study on its memory property,
  a critical characteristic in sequence tasks. In this work, we conduct a thorough
  investigation of the memory mechanism of TP recurrent models. Theoretically, we
  prove that a large degree p is an essential condition to achieve the long memory
  effect, yet it would lead to unstable dynamical behaviors. Empirically, we tackle
  this issue by extending the degree p from discrete to a differentiable domain, such
  that it is efficiently learnable from a variety of datasets. Taken together, the
  new model is expected to benefit from the long memory effect in a stable manner.
  We experimentally show that the proposed model achieves competitive performance
  compared to various advanced RNNs in both the single-cell and seq2seq architectures. "
