title: " Provable Hierarchical Imitation Learning via EM "
abstract: " Due to recent empirical successes, the options framework for hierarchical
  reinforcement learning is gaining increasing popularity. Rather than learning from
  rewards, we consider learning an options-type hierarchical policy from expert demonstrations.
  Such a problem is referred to as hierarchical imitation learning. Converting this
  problem to parameter inference in a latent variable model, we develop convergence
  guarantees for the EM approach proposed by Daniel et al. (2016b). The population
  level algorithm is analyzed as an intermediate step, which is nontrivial due to
  the samples being correlated. If the expert policy can be parameterized by a variant
  of the options framework, then, under regularity conditions, we prove that the proposed
  algorithm converges with high probability to a norm ball around the true parameter.
  To our knowledge, this is the first performance guarantee for an hierarchical imitation
  learning algorithm that only observes primitive state-action pairs. "
