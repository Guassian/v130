title: " Deep Probabilistic Accelerated Evaluation: A Robust Certifiable Rare-Event
  Simulation Methodology for Black-Box Safety-Critical Systems "
abstract: " Evaluating the reliability of intelligent physical systems against rare
  safety-critical events poses a huge testing burden for real-world applications.
  Simulation provides a useful platform to evaluate the extremal risks of these systems
  before their deployments. Importance Sampling (IS), while proven to be powerful
  for rare-event simulation, faces challenges in handling these learning-based systems
  due to their black-box nature that fundamentally undermines its efficiency guarantee,
  which can lead to under-estimation without diagnostically detected. We propose a
  framework called Deep Probabilistic Accelerated Evaluation (Deep-PrAE) to design
  statistically guaranteed IS, by converting black-box samplers that are versatile
  but could lack guarantees, into one with what we call a relaxed efficiency certificate
  that allows accurate estimation of bounds on the safety-critical event probability.
  We present the theory of Deep-PrAE that combines the dominating point concept with
  rare-event set learning via deep neural network classifiers, and demonstrate its
  effectiveness in numerical examples including the safety-testing of an intelligent
  driving algorithm. "
