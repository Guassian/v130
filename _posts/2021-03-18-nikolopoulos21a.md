title: " Group testing for connected communities "
abstract: " In this paper, we propose algorithms that leverage a known community structure
  to make group testing more efficient. We consider a population organized in disjoint
  communities: each individual participates in a community, and its infection probability
  depends on the community (s)he participates in. Use cases include families, students
  who participate in several classes, and workers who share common spaces. Group testing
  reduces the number of tests needed to identify the infected individuals by pooling
  diagnostic samples and testing them together. We show that if we design the testing
  strategy taking into account the community structure, we can significantly reduce
  the number of tests needed for adaptive and non-adaptive group testing, and can
  improve the reliability in cases where tests are noisy. "
