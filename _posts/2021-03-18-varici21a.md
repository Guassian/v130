title: " Learning Shared Subgraphs in Ising Model Pairs "
abstract: " Probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) are effective for capturing the
  statistical dependencies in stochastic databases. In many domains (e.g., working
  with multimodal data), one faces multiple information layers that can be modeled
  by structurally similar PGMs. While learning the structures of PGMs in isolation
  is well-investigated, the algorithmic design and performance limits of learning
  from multiple coupled PGMs are investigated far less. This paper considers learning
  the structural similarities shared by a pair of Ising PGMs. The objective is learning
  the shared structure with no regard for the structures exclusive to either of the
  graphs, and significantly different from the existing approaches that focus on entire
  structure of the graphs. We propose an algorithm for the shared structure learning
  objective, evaluate its performance empirically, and compare with existing approaches
  on structure learning of single graphs. "
