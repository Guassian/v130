title: " Fenchel-Young Losses with Skewed Entropies for Class-posterior Probability
  Estimation "
abstract: " We study class-posterior probability estimation (CPE) for binary responses
  where one class has much fewer data than the other. For example, events such as
  species co-occurrence in ecology and wars in political science are often much rarer
  than non-events. Logistic regression has been widely used for CPE, while it tends
  to underestimate the probability of rare events. Its main drawback is symmetry of
  the logit linkâ€”symmetric links can be misled by small and imbalanced samples because
  it is more incentivized to overestimate the majority class with finite samples.
  Parametric skewed links have been proposed to overcome this limitation, but their
  estimation usually results in nonconvex optimization unlike the logit link. Such
  nonconvexity is knotty not only from the computational viewpoint but also in terms
  of the parameter identifiability. In this paper, we provide a procedure to derive
  a convex loss for a skewed link based on the recently proposed Fenchel-Young losses.
  The derived losses are always convex and have a nice property suitable for class
  imbalance. The simulation shows the practicality of the derived losses. "
