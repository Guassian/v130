title: " Latent variable modeling with random features "
abstract: " Gaussian process-based latent variable models are flexible and theoretically
  grounded tools for nonlinear dimension reduction, but generalizing to non-Gaussian
  data likelihoods within this nonlinear framework is statistically challenging. Here,
  we use random features to develop a family of nonlinear dimension reduction models
  that are easily extensible to non-Gaussian data likelihoods; we call these random
  feature latent variable models (RFLVMs). By approximating a nonlinear relationship
  between the latent space and the observations with a function that is linear with
  respect to random features, we induce closed-form gradients of the posterior distribution
  with respect to the latent variable. This allows the RFLVM framework to support
  computationally tractable nonlinear latent variable models for a variety of data
  likelihoods in the exponential family without specialized derivations. Our generalized
  RFLVMs produce results comparable with other state-of-the-art dimension reduction
  methods on diverse types of data, including neural spike train recordings, images,
  and text data. "
