title: " List Learning with Attribute Noise "
abstract: " We introduce and study the model of list learning with attribute noise.
  Learning with attribute noise was introduced by Shackelford and Volper (COLT, 1988)
  as a variant of PAC learning, in which the algorithm has access to noisy examples
  and uncorrupted labels, and the goal is to recover an accurate hypothesis. Sloan
  (COLT, 1988) and Goldman and Sloan (Algorithmica, 1995) discovered information-theoretic
  limits to learning in this model, which have impeded further progress. In this article
  we extend the model to that of list learning, drawing inspiration from the list-decoding
  model in coding theory, and its recent variant studied in the context of learning.
  On the positive side, we show that sparse conjunctions can be efficiently list learned
  under some assumptions on the underlying ground-truth distribution. On the negative
  side, our results show that even in the list-learning model, efficient learning
  of parities and majorities is not possible regardless of the representation used. "
