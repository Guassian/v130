title: " An Analysis of the Adaptation Speed of Causal Models "
abstract: " Consider a collection of datasets generated by unknown interventions on
  an unknown structural causal model $G$. Recently, Bengio et al. (2020) conjectured
  that among all candidate models, $G$ is the fastest to adapt from one dataset to
  another, along with promising experiments. Indeed, intuitively $G$ has less mechanisms
  to adapt, but this justification is incomplete. Our contribution is a more thorough
  analysis of this hypothesis. We investigate the adaptation speed of cause-effect
  SCMs. Using convergence rates from stochastic optimization, we justify that a relevant
  proxy for adaptation speed is distance in parameter space after intervention. Applying
  this proxy to categorical and normal cause-effect models, we show two results. When
  the intervention is on the cause variable, the SCM with the correct causal direction
  is advantaged by a large factor. When the intervention is on the effect variable,
  we characterize the relative adaptation speed. Surprisingly, we find situations
  where the anticausal model is advantaged, falsifying the initial hypothesis. "
