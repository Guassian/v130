title: " Collaborative Classification from Noisy Labels "
abstract: " We consider a setting where users interact with a collection of N items
  on an online platform. We are given class labels possibly corrupted by noise, and
  we seek to recover the true class of each item. We postulate a simple probabilistic
  model of the interactions between users and items, based on the assumption that
  users interact with classes in different proportions. We then develop a message-passing
  algorithm that decodes the noisy class labels efficiently. Under suitable assumptions,
  our method provably recovers all items’ true classes in the large N limit, even
  when the interaction graph remains sparse. Empirically, we show that our approach
  is effective on several practical applications, including predicting the location
  of businesses, the category of consumer goods, and the language of audio content. "
