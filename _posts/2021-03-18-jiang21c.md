title: " On the Consistency of Metric and Non-Metric K-Medoids "
abstract: " We establish the consistency of K-medoids in the context of metric spaces.
  We start by proving that K-medoids is asymptotically equivalent to K-means restricted
  to the support of the underlying distribution under general conditions, including
  a wide selection of loss functions. This asymptotic equivalence, in turn, enables
  us to apply the work of Parna (1986) on the consistency of K-means. This general
  approach applies also to non-metric settings where only an ordering of the dissimilarities
  is available. We consider two types of ordinal information: one where all quadruple
  comparisons are available; and one where only triple comparisons are available.
  We provide some numerical experiments to illustrate our theory. "
