title: " When OT meets MoM: Robust estimation of Wasserstein Distance "
abstract: " Originated from Optimal Transport, the Wasserstein distance has gained
  importance in Machine Learning due to its appealing geometrical properties and the
  increasing availability of efficient approximations. It owes its recent ubiquity
  in generative modelling and variational inference to its ability to cope with distributions
  having non overlapping support. In this work, we consider the problem of estimating
  the Wasserstein distance between two probability distributions when observations
  are polluted by outliers. To that end, we investigate how to leverage a Medians
  of Means (MoM) approach to provide robust estimates. Exploiting the dual Kantorovitch
  formulation of the Wasserstein distance, we introduce and discuss novel MoM-based
  robust estimators whose consistency is studied under a data contamination model
  and for which convergence rates are provided. Beyond computational issues, the choice
  of the partition size, i.e., the unique parameter of theses robust estimators, is
  investigated in numerical experiments. Furthermore, these MoM estimators make Wasserstein
  Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) robust to outliers, as witnessed by an empirical
  study on two benchmarks CIFAR10 and Fashion MNIST. "
