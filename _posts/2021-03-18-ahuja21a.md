title: " Linear Regression Games: Convergence Guarantees to Approximate Out-of-Distribution
  Solutions "
abstract: " Recently, invariant risk minimization (IRM) (Arjovsky et al. 2019) was
  proposed as a promising solution to address out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization.
  In Ahuja et al. (2020), it was shown that solving for the Nash equilibria of a new
  class of “ensemble-games” is equivalent to solving IRM. In this work, we extend
  the framework in Ahuja et al. (2020) for linear regressions by projecting the ensemble-game
  on an $\\ell_{\\infty}$ ball. We show that such projections help achieve non-trivial
  out-of-distribution guarantees despite not achieving perfect invariance. For linear
  models with confounders, we prove that Nash equilibria of these games are closer
  to the ideal OOD solutions than the standard empirical risk minimization (ERM) and
  we also provide learning algorithms that provably converge to these Nash Equilibria.
  Empirical comparisons of the proposed approach with the state-of-the-art show consistent
  gains in achieving OOD solutions in several settings involving anti-causal variables
  and confounders. "
