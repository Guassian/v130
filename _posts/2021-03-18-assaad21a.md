title: " Counterfactual Representation Learning with Balancing Weights "
abstract: " A key to causal inference with observational data is achieving balance
  in predictive features associated with each treatment type. Recent literature has
  explored representation learning to achieve this goal. In this work, we discuss
  the pitfalls of these strategies – such as a steep trade-off between achieving balance
  and predictive power – and present a remedy via the integration of balancing weights
  in causal learning. Specifically, we theoretically link balance to the quality of
  propensity estimation, emphasize the importance of identifying a proper target population,
  and elaborate on the complementary roles of feature balancing and weight adjustments.
  Using these concepts, we then develop an algorithm for flexible, scalable and accurate
  estimation of causal effects. Finally, we show how the learned weighted representations
  may serve to facilitate alternative causal learning procedures with appealing statistical
  features. We conduct an extensive set of experiments on both synthetic examples
  and standard benchmarks, and report encouraging results relative to state-of-the-art
  baselines. "
