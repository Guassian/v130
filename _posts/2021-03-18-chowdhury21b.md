title: " Reinforcement Learning in Parametric MDPs with Exponential Families "
abstract: " Extending model-based regret minimization strategies for Markov decision
  processes (MDPs) beyond discrete state-action spaces requires structural assumptions
  on the reward and transition models. Existing parametric approaches establish regret
  guarantees by making strong assumptions about either the state transition distribution
  or the value function as a function of state-action features, and often do not satisfactorily
  capture classical problems like linear dynamical systems or factored MDPs. This
  paper introduces a new MDP transition model defined by a collection of linearly
  parameterized exponential families with $d$ unknown parameters. For finite-horizon
  episodic RL with horizon $H$ in this MDP model, we propose a model-based upper confidence
  RL algorithm (Exp-UCRL) that solves a penalized maximum likelihood estimation problem
  to learn the $d$-dimensional representation of the transition distribution, balancing
  the exploitation-exploration tradeoff using confidence sets in the exponential family
  space. We demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm by proving a frequentist (worst-case)
  regret bound that is of order $\\tilde O(d\\sqrt{H^3 N})$, sub-linear in total time
  $N$, linear in dimension $d$, and polynomial in the planning horizon $H$. This is
  achieved by deriving a novel concentration inequality for conditional exponential
  families that might be of independent interest. The exponential family MDP model
  also admits an efficient posterior sampling-style algorithm for which a similar
  guarantee on the Bayesian regret is shown. "
