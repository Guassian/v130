title: " Instance-Wise Minimax-Optimal Algorithms for Logistic Bandits "
abstract: " Logistic Bandits have recently attracted substantial attention, by providing
  an uncluttered yet challenging framework for understanding the impact of non-linearity
  in parametrized bandits. It was shown by Faury et al. (2020) that the learning-theoretic
  difficulties of Logistic Bandits can be embodied by a large (sometimes prohibitively)
  problem-dependent constant $\\kappa$, characterizing the magnitude of the rewardâ€™s
  non-linearity. In this paper we introduce an algorithm for which we provide a refined
  analysis. This allows for a better characterization of the effect of non-linearity
  and yields improved problem-dependent guarantees. In most favorable cases this leads
  to a regret upper-bound scaling as $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(d\\sqrt{T/\\kappa})$,
  which dramatically improves over the $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(d\\sqrt{T}+\\kappa)$
  state-of-the-art guarantees. We prove that this rate is \\emph{minimax-optimal}
  by deriving a $\\Omega(d\\sqrt{T/\\kappa})$ problem-dependent lower-bound. Our analysis
  identifies two regimes (permanent and transitory) of the regret, which ultimately
  re-conciliates (Faury et al., 2020) with the Bayesian approach of Dong et al. (2019).
  In contrast to previous works, we find that in the permanent regime non-linearity
  can dramatically ease the exploration-exploitation trade-off. While it also impacts
  the length of the transitory phase in a problem-dependent fashion, we show that
  this impact is mild in most reasonable configurations. "
