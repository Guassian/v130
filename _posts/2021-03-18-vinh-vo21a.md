title: " Causal Modeling with Stochastic Confounders "
abstract: " This work extends causal inference in temporal models with stochastic
  confounders. We propose a new approach to variational estimation of causal inference
  based on a representer theorem with a random input space. We estimate causal effects
  involving latent confounders that may be interdependent and time-varying from sequential,
  repeated measurements in an observational study. Our approach extends current work
  that assumes independent, non-temporal latent confounders with potentially biased
  estimators. We introduce a simple yet elegant algorithm without parametric specification
  on model components. Our method avoids the need for expensive and careful parameterization
  in deploying complex models, such as deep neural networks in existing approaches,
  for causal inference and analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
  on various benchmark temporal datasets. "
