title: " Maximal Couplings of the Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm "
abstract: " Couplings play a central role in the analysis of Markov chain Monte Carlo
  algorithms and appear increasingly often in the algorithms themselves, e.g. in convergence
  diagnostics, parallelization, and variance reduction techniques. Existing couplings
  of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm handle the proposal and acceptance steps separately
  and fall short of the upper bound on one-step meeting probabilities given by the
  coupling inequality. This paper introduces maximal couplings which achieve this
  bound while retaining the practical advantages of current methods. We consider the
  properties of these couplings and examine their behavior on a selection of numerical
  examples. "
