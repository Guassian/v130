title: " Non-Stationary Off-Policy Optimization "
abstract: " Off-policy learning is a framework for evaluating and optimizing policies
  without deploying them, from data collected by another policy. Real-world environments
  are typically non-stationary and the offline learned policies should adapt to these
  changes. To address this challenge, we study the novel problem of off-policy optimization
  in piecewise-stationary contextual bandits. Our proposed solution has two phases.
  In the offline learning phase, we partition logged data into categorical latent
  states and learn a near-optimal sub-policy for each state. In the online deployment
  phase, we adaptively switch between the learned sub-policies based on their performance.
  This approach is practical and analyzable, and we provide guarantees on both the
  quality of off-policy optimization and the regret during online deployment. To show
  the effectiveness of our approach, we compare it to state-of-the-art baselines on
  both synthetic and real-world datasets. Our approach outperforms methods that act
  only on observed context. "
