title: " Prediction with Finitely many Errors Almost Surely "
abstract: " Using only samples from a probabilistic model, we predict properties of
  the model and of future observations. The prediction game continues in an online
  fashion as the sample size grows with new observations. After each prediction, the
  predictor incurs a binary (0-1) loss. The probability model underlying a sample
  is otherwise unknown except that it belongs to a known class of models. The goal
  is to make finitely many errors (i.e. loss of 1) with probability 1 under the generating
  model, no matter what it may be in the known model class. Model classes admitting
  predictors that make only finitely many errors are eventually almost surely (eas)
  predictable. When the losses incurred are observable (the supervised case), we completely
  characterize eas predictable classes. We provide analogous results in the unsupervised
  case. Our results have a natural interpretation in terms of regularization. In eas-predictable
  classes, we study if it is possible to have a universal stopping rule that identifies
  (to any given confidence) when no more errors will be made. Classes admitting such
  a stopping rule are eas learnable. When samples are generated iid, we provide a
  complete characterization of eas learnability. We also study cases when samples
  are not generated iid, but a full characterization remains open at this point. "
