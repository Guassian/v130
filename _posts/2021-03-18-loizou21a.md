title: " Stochastic Polyak Step-size for SGD: An Adaptive Learning Rate for Fast Convergence "
abstract: " We propose a stochastic variant of the classical Polyak step-size (Polyak,
  1987) commonly used in the subgradient method. Although computing the Polyak step-size
  requires knowledge of the optimal function values, this information is readily available
  for typical modern machine learning applications. Consequently, the proposed stochastic
  Polyak step-size (SPS) is an attractive choice for setting the learning rate for
  stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We provide theoretical convergence guarantees
  for SGD equipped with SPS in different settings, including strongly convex, convex
  and non-convex functions. Furthermore, our analysis results in novel convergence
  guarantees for SGD with a constant step-size. We show that SPS is particularly effective
  when training over-parameterized models capable of interpolating the training data.
  In this setting, we prove that SPS enables SGD to converge to the true solution
  at a fast rate without requiring the knowledge of any problem-dependent constants
  or additional computational overhead. We experimentally validate our theoretical
  results via extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets. We demonstrate
  the strong performance of SGD with SPS compared to state-of-the-art optimization
  methods when training over-parameterized models. "
