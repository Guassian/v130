title: " On Projection Robust Optimal Transport: Sample Complexity and Model Misspecification "
abstract: " Optimal transport (OT) distances are increasingly used as loss functions
  for statistical inference, notably in the learning of generative models or supervised
  learning. Yet, the behavior of minimum Wasserstein estimators is poorly understood,
  notably in high-dimensional regimes or under model misspecification. In this work
  we adopt the viewpoint of projection robust (PR) OT, which seeks to maximize the
  OT cost between two measures by choosing a $k$-dimensional subspace onto which they
  can be projected. Our first contribution is to establish several fundamental statistical
  properties of PR Wasserstein distances, complementing and improving previous literature
  that has been restricted to one-dimensional and well-specified cases. Next, we propose
  the integral PR Wasserstein (IPRW) distance as an alternative to the PRW distance,
  by averaging rather than optimizing on subspaces. Our complexity bounds can help
  explain why both PRW and IPRW distances outperform Wasserstein distances empirically
  in high-dimensional inference tasks. Finally, we consider parametric inference using
  the PRW distance. We provide an asymptotic guarantee of two types of minimum PRW
  estimators and formulate a central limit theorem for max-sliced Wasserstein estimator
  under model misspecification. To enable our analysis on PRW with projection dimension
  larger than one, we devise a novel combination of variational analysis and statistical
  theory. "
