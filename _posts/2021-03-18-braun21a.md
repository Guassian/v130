title: " Clustering multilayer graphs with missing nodes "
abstract: " Relationship between agents can be conveniently represented by graphs.
  When these relationships have different modalities, they are better modelled by
  multilayer graphs where each layer is associated with one modality. Such graphs
  arise naturally in many contexts including biological and social networks. Clustering
  is a fundamental problem in network analysis where the goal is to regroup nodes
  with similar connectivity profiles. In the past decade, various clustering methods
  have been extended from the unilayer setting to multilayer graphs in order to incorporate
  the information provided by each layer. While most existing works assume â€“ rather
  restrictively - that all layers share the same set of nodes, we propose a new framework
  that allows for layers to be defined on different sets of nodes. In particular,
  the nodes not recorded in a layer are treated as missing. Within this paradigm,
  we investigate several generalizations of well-known clustering methods in the complete
  setting to the incomplete one and prove consistency results under the Multi-Layer
  Stochastic Block Model assumption. Our theoretical results are complemented by thorough
  numerical comparisons between our proposed algorithms on synthetic data, and also
  on several real datasets, thus highlighting the promising behaviour of our methods
  in various realistic settings. "
