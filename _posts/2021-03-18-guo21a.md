title: " Consistent k-Median: Simpler, Better and Robust "
abstract: " In this paper we introduce and study the online consistent k-clustering
  with outliers problem, generalizing the non-outlier version of the problem studied
  in Lattanzi-Vassilvitskii [18]. We show that a simple local-search based on-line
  algorithm can give a bicriteria constant approximation for the problem with O(k^2
  log^2(nD)) swaps of medians (recourse) in total, where D is the diameter of the
  metric. When restricted to the problem without outliers, our algorithm is simpler,
  deterministic and gives better approximation ratio and recourse, compared to that
  of Lattanzi-Vassilvitskii [18]. "
