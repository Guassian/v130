title: " Deep Neural Networks Are Congestion Games: From Loss Landscape to Wardrop
  Equilibrium and Beyond "
abstract: " The theoretical analysis of deep neural networks (DNN) is arguably among
  the most challenging research directions in machine learning (ML) right now, as
  it requires from scientists to lay novel statistical learning foundations to explain
  their behaviour in practice. While some success has been achieved recently in this
  endeavour, the question on whether DNNs can be analyzed using the tools from other
  scientific fields outside the ML community has not received the attention it may
  well have deserved. In this paper, we explore the interplay between DNNs and game
  theory (GT), and show how one can benefit from the classic readily available results
  from the latter when analyzing the former. In particular, we consider the widely
  studied class of congestion games, and illustrate their intrinsic relatedness to
  both linear and non-linear DNNs and to the properties of their loss surface. Beyond
  retrieving the state-of-the-art results from the literature, we argue that our work
  provides a very promising novel tool for analyzing the DNNs and support this claim
  by proposing concrete open problems that can advance significantly our understanding
  of DNNs when solved. "
