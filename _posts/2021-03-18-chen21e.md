title: " Fast Statistical Leverage Score Approximation in Kernel Ridge Regression "
abstract: " Nyström approximation is a fast randomized method that rapidly solves
  kernel ridge regression (KRR) problems through sub-sampling the n-by-n empirical
  kernel matrix appearing in the objective function. However, the performance of such
  a sub-sampling method heavily relies on correctly estimating the statistical leverage
  scores for forming the sampling distribution, which can be as costly as solving
  the original KRR. In this work, we propose a linear time (modulo poly-log terms)
  algorithm to accurately approximate the statistical leverage scores in the stationary-kernel-based
  KRR with theoretical guarantees. Particularly, by analyzing the first-order condition
  of the KRR objective, we derive an analytic formula, which depends on both the input
  distribution and the spectral density of stationary kernels, for capturing the non-uniformity
  of the statistical leverage scores. Numerical experiments demonstrate that with
  the same prediction accuracy our method is orders of magnitude more efficient than
  existing methods in selecting the representative sub-samples in the Nyström approximation. "
