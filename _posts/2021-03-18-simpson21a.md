title: " The Minecraft Kernel: Modelling correlated Gaussian Processes in the Fourier
  domain "
abstract: " In the univariate setting, using the kernel spectral representation is
  an appealing approach for generating stationary covariance functions. However, performing
  the same task for multiple-output Gaussian processes is substantially more challenging.
  We demonstrate that current approaches to modelling cross-covariances with a spectral
  mixture kernel possess a critical blind spot. Pairs of highly correlated (or highly
  anti-correlated) processes are not reproducible, aside from the special case when
  their spectral densities are of identical shape. We present a solution to this issue
  by replacing the conventional Gaussian components of a spectral mixture with block
  components of finite bandwidth (i.e. rectangular step functions). The proposed family
  of kernel represents the first multi-output generalisation of the spectral mixture
  kernel that can approximate any stationary multi-output kernel to arbitrary precision. "
