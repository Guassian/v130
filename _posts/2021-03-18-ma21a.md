title: " Learning-to-Rank with Partitioned Preference: Fast Estimation for the Plackett-Luce
  Model "
abstract: " We consider the problem of listwise learning-to-rank (LTR) on data with
  \\textit{partitioned preference}, where a set of items are sliced into ordered and
  disjoint partitions, but the ranking of items within a partition is unknown. The
  Plackett-Luce (PL) model has been widely used in listwise LTR methods. However,
  given $N$ items with $M$ partitions, calculating the likelihood of data with partitioned
  preference under the PL model has a time complexity of $O(N+S!)$, where $S$ is the
  maximum size of the top $M-1$ partitions. This computational challenge restrains
  existing PL-based listwise LTR methods to only a special case of partitioned preference,
  \\textit{top-$K$ ranking}, where the exact order of the top $K$ items is known.
  In this paper, we exploit a random utility model formulation of the PL model and
  propose an efficient approach through numerical integration for calculating the
  likelihood. This numerical approach reduces the aforementioned time complexity to
  $O(N+MS)$, which allows training deep-neural-network-based ranking models with a
  large output space. We demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms well-known
  LTR baselines and remains scalable through both simulation experiments and applications
  to real-world eXtreme Multi-Label (XML) classification tasks. The proposed method
  also achieves state-of-the-art performance on XML datasets with relatively large
  numbers of labels per sample. "
