title: " A Kernel-Based Approach to Non-Stationary Reinforcement Learning in Metric
  Spaces "
abstract: " In this work, we propose KeRNS: an algorithm for episodic reinforcement
  learning in non-stationary Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) whose state-action set
  is endowed with a metric. Using a non-parametric model of the MDP built with time-dependent
  kernels, we prove a regret bound that scales with the covering dimension of the
  state-action space and the total variation of the MDP with time, which quantifies
  its level of non-stationarity. Our method generalizes previous approaches based
  on sliding windows and exponential discounting used to handle changing environments.
  We further propose a practical implementation of KeRNS, we analyze its regret and
  validate it experimentally. "
