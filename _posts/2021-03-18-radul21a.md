title: " The Base Measure Problem and its Solution "
abstract: " Probabilistic programming systems generally compute with probability density
  functions, leaving the base measure of each such function implicit. This mostly
  works, but creates problems when densities with respect to different base measures
  are accidentally combined or compared. Mistakes also happen when computing volume
  corrections for continuous changes of variables, which in general depend on the
  support measure. We motivate and clarify the problem in the context of a composable
  library of probability distributions and bijective transformations. We solve the
  problem by standardizing on Hausdorff measure as a base, and deriving formulas for
  comparing and combining mixed-dimension densities, as well as updating densities
  with respect to Hausdorff measure under diffeomorphic transformations. We also propose
  a software architecture that implements these formulas efficiently in the common
  case. We hope that by adopting our solution, probabilistic programming systems can
  become more robust and general, and make a broader class of models accessible to
  practitioners. "
