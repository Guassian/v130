title: " No-regret Algorithms for Multi-task Bayesian Optimization "
abstract: " We consider multi-objective optimization (MOO) of an unknown vector-valued
  function in the non-parametric Bayesian optimization (BO) setting. Our aim is to
  maximize the expected cumulative utility of all objectives, as expressed by a given
  prior over a set of scalarization functions. Most existing BO algorithms do not
  model the fact that the multiple objectives, or equivalently, tasks can share similarities,
  and even the few that do lack rigorous, finite-time regret guarantees that capture
  explicitly inter-task structure. In this work, we address this problem by modelling
  inter-task dependencies using a multi-task kernel and develop two novel BO algorithms
  based on random scalarization of the objectives. Our algorithms employ vector-valued
  kernel regression as a stepping stone and belong to the upper confidence bound class
  of algorithms. Under a smoothness assumption that the unknown vector-valued function
  is an element of the reproducing kernel Hilbert space associated with the multi-task
  kernel, we derive worst-case regret bounds for our algorithms that explicitly capture
  the similarities between tasks. We numerically benchmark our algorithms on both
  synthetic and real-life MOO problems, and show the advantages offered by learning
  with multi-task kernels. "
