title: " Hyperparameter Transfer Learning with Adaptive Complexity "
abstract: " Bayesian optimization (BO) is a data-efficient approach to automatically
  tune the hyperparameters of machine learning models. In practice, one frequently
  has to solve similar hyperparameter tuning problems sequentially. For example, one
  might have to tune a type of neural network learned across a series of different
  classification problems. Recent work on multi-task BO exploits knowledge gained
  from previous hyperparameter tuning tasks to speed up a new tuning task. However,
  previous approaches do not account for the fact that BO is a sequential decision
  making procedure. Hence, there is in general a mismatch between the number of evaluations
  collected in the current tuning task compared to the number of evaluations accumulated
  in all previously completed tasks. In this work, we enable multi-task BO to compensate
  for this mismatch, such that the transfer learning procedure is able to handle different
  data regimes in a principled way. We propose a new multi-task BO method that learns
  a set of ordered, non-linear basis functions of increasing complexity via nested
  drop-out and automatic relevance determination. Experiments on a variety of hyperparameter
  tuning problems show that our method improves the sample efficiency of recently
  published multi-task BO methods. "
