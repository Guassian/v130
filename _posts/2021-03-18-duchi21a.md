title: " A constrained risk inequality for general losses "
abstract: " We provide a general constrained risk inequality that applies to arbitrary
  non-decreasing losses, extending a result of Brown and Low [\\emph{Ann. Stat. 1996}].
  Given two distributions $P_0$ and $P_1$, we find a lower bound for the risk of estimating
  a parameter $\\theta(P_1)$ under $P_1$ given an upper bound on the risk of estimating
  the parameter $\\theta(P_0)$ under $P_0$. The inequality is a useful pedagogical
  tool, as its proof relies only on the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality, it applies to
  general losses, and it transparently gives risk lower bounds on super-efficient
  and adaptive estimators. "
