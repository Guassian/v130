title: " Provably Safe PAC-MDP Exploration Using Analogies "
abstract: ' A key challenge in applying reinforcement learning to safety-critical
  domains is understanding how to balance exploration (needed to attain good performance
  on the task) with safety (needed to avoid catastrophic failure). Although a growing
  line of work in reinforcement learning has investigated this area of "safe exploration,"
  most existing techniques either 1) do not guarantee safety during the actual exploration
  process; and/or 2) limit the problem to a priori known and/or deterministic transition
  dynamics with strong smoothness assumptions. Addressing this gap, we propose Analogous
  Safe-state Exploration (ASE), an algorithm for provably safe exploration in MDPs
  with unknown, stochastic dynamics. Our method exploits analogies between state-action
  pairs to safely learn a near-optimal policy in a PAC-MDP sense. Additionally, ASE
  also guides exploration towards the most task-relevant states, which empirically
  results in significant improvements in terms of sample efficiency, when compared
  to existing methods. '
