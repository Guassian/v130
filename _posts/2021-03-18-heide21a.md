title: " Shadow Manifold Hamiltonian Monte Carlo "
abstract: " Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and its descendants have found success in machine
  learning and computational statistics due to their ability to draw samples in high
  dimensions with greater efficiency than classical MCMC. One of these derivatives,
  Riemannian manifold Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (RMHMC), better adapts the sampler to
  the geometry of the target density, allowing for improved performances in sampling
  problems with complex geometric features. Other approaches have boosted acceptance
  rates by sampling from an integrator-dependent “shadow density” and compensating
  for the induced bias via importance sampling. We combine the benefits of RMHMC with
  those attained by sampling from the shadow density, by deriving the shadow Hamiltonian
  corresponding to the generalized leapfrog integrator used in RMHMC. This leads to
  a new algorithm, shadow manifold Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, that shows improved performance
  over RMHMC, and leaves the target density invariant. "
