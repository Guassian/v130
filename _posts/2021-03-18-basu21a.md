title: " Contextual Blocking Bandits "
abstract: " We study a novel variant of the multi-armed bandit problem, where at each
  time step, the player observes an independently sampled context that determines
  the armsâ€™ mean rewards. However, playing an arm blocks it (across all contexts)
  for a fixed number of future time steps. The above contextual setting captures important
  scenarios such as recommendation systems or ad placement with diverse users. This
  problem has been recently studied [Dickerson et al., AAAI 2018] in the full-information
  setting (i.e., assuming knowledge of the mean context-dependent arm rewards), where
  competitive ratio bounds have been derived. We focus on the bandit setting, where
  these means are initially unknown; we propose a UCB-based variant of the full-information
  algorithm that guarantees a $\\mathcal{O}(\\log T)$-regret w.r.t. an $\\alpha$-optimal
  strategy in $T$ time steps, matching the $\\Omega(\\log(T))$ regret lower bound
  in this setting. Due to the time correlations caused by blocking, existing techniques
  for upper bounding regret fail. For proving our regret bounds, we introduce the
  novel concepts of delayed exploitation and opportunistic subsampling and combine
  them with ideas from combinatorial bandits and non-stationary Markov chains coupling. "
