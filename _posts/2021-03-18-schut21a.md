title: " Generating Interpretable Counterfactual Explanations By Implicit Minimisation
  of Epistemic and Aleatoric Uncertainties "
abstract: " Counterfactual explanations (CEs) are a practical tool for demonstrating
  why machine learning classifiers make particular decisions. For CEs to be useful,
  it is important that they are easy for users to interpret. Existing methods for
  generating interpretable CEs rely on auxiliary generative models, which may not
  be suitable for complex datasets, and incur engineering overhead. We introduce a
  simple and fast method for generating interpretable CEs in a white-box setting without
  an auxiliary model, by using the predictive uncertainty of the classifier. Our experiments
  show that our proposed algorithm generates more interpretable CEs, according to
  IM1 scores (Van Looveren et al., 2019), than existing methods. Additionally, our
  approach allows us to estimate the uncertainty of a CE, which may be important in
  safety-critical applications, such as those in the medical domain. "
