title: " Hierarchical Inducing Point Gaussian Process for Inter-domian Observations "
abstract: " We examine the general problem of inter-domain Gaussian Processes (GPs):
  problems where the GP realization and the noisy observations of that realization
  lie on different domains. When the mapping between those domains is linear, such
  as integration or diï¬€erentiation, inference is still closed form. However, many
  of the scaling and approximation techniques that our community has developed do
  not apply to this setting. In this work, we introduce the hierarchical inducing
  point GP (HIP-GP), a scalable inter-domain GP inference method that enables us to
  improve the approximation accuracy by increasing the number of inducing points to
  the millions. HIP-GP, which relies on inducing points with grid structure and a
  stationary kernel assumption, is suitable for low-dimensional problems. In developing
  HIP-GP, we introduce (1) a fast whitening strategy, and (2) a novel preconditioner
  for conjugate gradients which can be helpful in general GP settings. "
