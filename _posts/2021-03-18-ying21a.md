title: " Minimax Estimation of Laplacian Constrained Precision Matrices "
abstract: " This paper considers the problem of high-dimensional sparse precision
  matrix estimation under Laplacian constraints. We prove that the Laplacian constraints
  bring favorable properties for estimation: the Gaussian maximum likelihood estimator
  exists and is unique almost surely on the basis of one observation, irrespective
  of the dimension. We establish the optimal rate of convergence under Frobenius norm
  by the derivation of the minimax lower and upper bounds. The minimax lower bound
  is obtained by applying Le Cam-Assouad’s method with a novel construction of a subparameter
  space of multivariate normal distributions. The minimax upper bound is established
  by designing an adaptive $\\ell_1$-norm regularized maximum likelihood estimation
  method and quantifying the rate of convergence. We prove that the proposed estimator
  attains the optimal rate of convergence with an overwhelming probability. Numerical
  experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimator. "
