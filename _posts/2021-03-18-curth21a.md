title: " Nonparametric Estimation of Heterogeneous Treatment Effects: From Theory
  to Learning Algorithms "
abstract: " The need to evaluate treatment effectiveness is ubiquitous in most of
  empirical science, and interest in flexibly investigating effect heterogeneity is
  growing rapidly. To do so, a multitude of model-agnostic, nonparametric meta-learners
  have been proposed in recent years. Such learners decompose the treatment effect
  estimation problem into separate sub-problems, each solvable using standard supervised
  learning methods. Choosing between different meta-learners in a data-driven manner
  is difficult, as it requires access to counterfactual information. Therefore, with
  the ultimate goal of building better understanding of the conditions under which
  some learners can be expected to perform better than others a priori, we theoretically
  analyze four broad meta-learning strategies which rely on plug-in estimation and
  pseudo-outcome regression. We highlight how this theoretical reasoning can be used
  to guide principled algorithm design and translate our analyses into practice by
  considering a variety of neural network architectures as base-learners for the discussed
  meta-learning strategies. In a simulation study, we showcase the relative strengths
  of the learners under different data-generating processes. "
