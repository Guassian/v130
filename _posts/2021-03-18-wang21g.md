title: " Beyond Marginal Uncertainty: How Accurately can Bayesian Regression Models
  Estimate Posterior Predictive Correlations? "
abstract: " While uncertainty estimation is a well-studied topic in deep learning,
  most such work focuses on marginal uncertainty estimates, i.e. the predictive mean
  and variance at individual input locations. But it is often more useful to estimate
  predictive correlations between the function values at different input locations.
  In this paper, we consider the problem of benchmarking how accurately Bayesian models
  can estimate predictive correlations. We first consider a downstream task which
  depends on posterior predictive correlations: transductive active learning (TAL).
  We find that TAL makes better use of modelsâ€™ uncertainty estimates than ordinary
  active learning, and recommend this as a benchmark for evaluating Bayesian models.
  Since TAL is too expensive and indirect to guide development of algorithms, we introduce
  two metrics which more directly evaluate the predictive correlations and which can
  be computed efficiently: meta-correlations (i.e. the correlations between the models
  correlation estimates and the true values), and cross-normalized likelihoods (XLL).
  We validate these metrics by demonstrating their consistency with TAL performance
  and obtain insights about the relative performance of current Bayesian neural net
  and Gaussian process models. "
