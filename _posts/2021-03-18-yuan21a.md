title: " Stability and Risk Bounds of Iterative Hard Thresholding "
abstract: " The Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT) algorithm is one of the most popular
  and promising greedy pursuit methods for high-dimensional statistical estimation
  under cardinality constraint. The existing analysis of IHT mostly focuses on parameter
  estimation and sparsity recovery consistency. From the perspective of statistical
  learning theory, another fundamental question is how well the IHT estimation would
  perform on unseen samples. The answer to this question is important for understanding
  the generalization ability of IHT yet has remaind elusive. In this paper, we investigate
  this problem and develop a novel generalization theory for IHT from the viewpoint
  of algorithmic stability. Our theory reveals that: 1) under natural conditions on
  the empirical risk function over $n$ samples of dimension $p$, IHT with sparsity
  level $k$ enjoys an $\\mathcal{\\tilde O}(n^{-1/2}\\sqrt{k\\log(n)\\log(p)})$ rate
  of convergence in sparse excess risk; and 2) a fast rate of order $\\mathcal{\\tilde
  O}(n^{-1}k(\\log^3(n)+\\log(p)))$ can be derived for strongly convex risk function
  under certain strong-signal conditions. The results have been substantialized to
  sparse linear regression and logistic regression models along with numerical evidence
  provided to support our theory. "
