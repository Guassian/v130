title: " On the Absence of Spurious Local Minima in Nonlinear Low-Rank Matrix Recovery
  Problems "
abstract: " The restricted isometry property (RIP) is a well-known condition that
  guarantees the absence of spurious local minima in low-rank matrix recovery problems
  with linear measurements. In this paper, we introduce a novel property named bound
  difference property (BDP) to study low-rank matrix recovery problems with nonlinear
  measurements. Using RIP and BDP jointly, we propose a new criterion to certify the
  nonexistence of spurious local minima in the rank-1 case, and prove that it leads
  to a much stronger theoretical guarantee than the existing bounds on RIP. "
