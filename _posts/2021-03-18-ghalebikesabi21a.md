title: " Deep Generative Missingness Pattern-Set Mixture Models "
abstract: " We propose a variational autoencoder architecture to model both ignorable
  and nonignorable missing data using pattern-set mixtures as proposed by Little (1993).
  Our model explicitly learns to cluster the missing data into missingness pattern
  sets based on the observed data and missingness masks. Underpinning our approach
  is the assumption that the data distribution under missingness is probabilistically
  semi-supervised by samples from the observed data distribution. Our setup trades
  off the characteristics of ignorable and nonignorable missingness and can thus be
  applied to data of both types. We evaluate our method on a wide range of data sets
  with different types of missingness and achieve state-of-the-art imputation performance.
  Our model outperforms many common imputation algorithms, especially when the amount
  of missing data is high and the missingness mechanism is nonignorable. "
