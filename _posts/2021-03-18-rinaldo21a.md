title: " Localizing Changes in High-Dimensional Regression Models "
abstract: " This paper addresses the problem of localizing change points in high-dimensional
  linear regression models with piecewise constant regression coefficients. We develop
  a dynamic programming approach to estimate the locations of the change points whose
  performance improves upon the current state-of-the-art, even as the dimension, the
  sparsity of the regression coefficients, the temporal spacing between two consecutive
  change points, and the magnitude of the difference of two consecutive regression
  coefficient vectors are allowed to vary with the sample size. Furthermore, we devise
  a computationally-efficient refinement procedure that provably reduces the localization
  error of preliminary estimates of the change points. We demonstrate minimax lower
  bounds on the localization error that nearly match the upper bound on the localization
  error of our methodology and show that the signal-to-noise condition we impose is
  essentially the weakest possible based on information-theoretic arguments. Extensive
  numerical results support our theoretical findings, and experiments on real air
  quality data reveal change points supported by historical information not used by
  the algorithm. "
