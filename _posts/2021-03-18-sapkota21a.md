title: " Distributionally Robust Optimization for Deep Kernel Multiple Instance Learning "
abstract: " Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) provides a promising solution to many
  real-world problems, where labels are only available at the bag level but missing
  for instances due to a high labeling cost. As a powerful Bayesian non-parametric
  model, Gaussian Processes (GP) have been extended from classical supervised learning
  to MIL settings, aiming to identify the most likely positive (or least negative)
  instance from a positive (or negative) bag using only the bag-level labels. However,
  solely focusing on a single instance in a bag makes the model less robust to outliers
  or multi-modal scenarios, where a single bag contains a diverse set of positive
  instances. We propose a general GP mixture framework that simultaneously considers
  multiple instances through a latent mixture model. By adding a top-k constraint,
  the framework is equivalent to choosing the top-k most positive instances, making
  it more robust to outliers and multimodal scenarios. We further introduce a Distributionally
  Robust Optimization (DRO) constraint that removes the limitation of specifying a
  fix k value. To ensure the prediction power over high-dimensional data (e.g., videos
  and images) that are common in MIL, we augment the GP kernel with fixed basis functions
  by using a deep neural network to learn adaptive basis functions so that the covariance
  structure of high-dimensional data can be accurately captured. Experiments are conducted
  on highly challenging real-world video anomaly detection tasks to demonstrate the
  effectiveness of the proposed model. "
