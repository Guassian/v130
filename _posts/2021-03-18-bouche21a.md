title: " Nonlinear Functional Output Regression: A Dictionary Approach "
abstract: " To address functional-output regression, we introduce projection learning
  (PL), a novel dictionary-based approach that learns to predict a function that is
  expanded on a dictionary while minimizing an empirical risk based on a functional
  loss. PL makes it possible to use non orthogonal dictionaries and can then be combined
  with dictionary learning; it is thus much more flexible than expansion-based approaches
  relying on vectorial losses. This general method is instantiated with reproducing
  kernel Hilbert spaces of vector-valued functions as kernel-based projection learning
  (KPL). For the functional square loss, two closed-form estimators are proposed,
  one for fully observed output functions and the other for partially observed ones.
  Both are backed theoretically by an excess risk analysis. Then, in the more general
  setting of integral losses based on differentiable ground losses, KPL is implemented
  using first-order optimization for both fully and partially observed output functions.
  Eventually, several robustness aspects of the proposed algorithms are highlighted
  on a toy dataset; and a study on two real datasets shows that they are competitive
  compared to other nonlinear approaches. Notably, using the square loss and a learnt
  dictionary, KPL enjoys a particularily attractive trade-off between computational
  cost and performances. "
