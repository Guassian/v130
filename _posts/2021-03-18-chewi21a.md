title: " Fast and Smooth Interpolation on Wasserstein Space "
abstract: " We propose a new method for smoothly interpolating probability measures
  using the geometry of optimal transport. To that end, we reduce this problem to
  the classical Euclidean setting, allowing us to directly leverage the extensive
  toolbox of spline interpolation. Unlike previous approaches to measure-valued splines,
  our interpolated curves (i) have a clear interpretation as governing particle flows,
  which is natural for applications, and (ii) come with the first approximation guarantees
  on Wasserstein space. Finally, we demonstrate the broad applicability of our interpolation
  methodology by fitting surfaces of measures using thin-plate splines. "
