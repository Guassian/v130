title: " Combinatorial Gaussian Process Bandits with Probabilistically Triggered Arms "
abstract: " Combinatorial bandit models and algorithms are used in many sequential
  decision-making tasks ranging from item list recommendation to influence maximization.
  Typical algorithms proposed for combinatorial bandits, including combinatorial UCB
  (CUCB) and combinatorial Thompson sampling (CTS) do not exploit correlations between
  base arms during the learning process. Moreover, their regret is usually analyzed
  under independent base arm outcomes. In this paper, we use Gaussian Processes (GPs)
  to model correlations between base arms. In particular, we consider a combinatorial
  bandit model with probabilistically triggered arms, and assume that the expected
  base arm outcome function is a sample from a GP. We assume that the learner has
  access to an exact computation oracle, which returns an optimal solution given expected
  base arm outcomes, and analyze the regret of Combinatorial Gaussian Process Upper
  Confidence Bound (ComGP-UCB) algorithm for this setting. Under (triggering probability
  modulated) Lipschitz continuity assumption on the expected reward function, we derive
  ($O( \\sqrt{m T \\log T \\gamma_{T, \\boldsymbol{\\mu}}^{PTA}})$) $O(m \\sqrt{\\frac{T
  \\log T}{p^*}})$ upper bounds for the regret of ComGP-UCB that hold with high probability,
  where $m$ denotes the number of base arms, $p^*$ denotes the minimum non-zero triggering
  probability, and $\\gamma_{T, \\boldsymbol{\\mu}}^{PTA}$ denotes the pseudo-information
  gain. Finally, we show via simulations that when the correlations between base arm
  outcomes are strong, ComGP-UCB significantly outperforms CUCB and CTS. "
