title: " A Change of Variables Method For Rectangular Matrix-Vector Products "
abstract: " Rectangular matrix-vector products (MVPs) are used extensively throughout
  machine learning and are fundamental to neural networks such as multi-layer perceptrons.
  However, the use of rectangular MVPs in successive normalizing flow transformations
  is notably missing. This paper identifies this methodological gap and plugs it with
  a tall and wide MVP change of variables formula. Our theory builds up to a practical
  algorithm that envelops existing dimensionality increasing flow methods such as
  augmented flows. We show that tall MVPs are closely related to the stochastic inverse
  of wide MVPs and empirically demonstrate that they improve density estimation over
  existing dimension changing methods. "
