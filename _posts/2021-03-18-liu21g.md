title: " Variable Selection with Rigorous Uncertainty Quantification using Deep Bayesian
  Neural Networks: Posterior Concentration and Bernstein-von Mises Phenomenon "
abstract: " This work develops a theoretical basis for the deep Bayesian neural network
  (BNN)’s ability in performing high-dimensional variable selection with rigorous
  uncertainty quantification. We develop new Bayesian non-parametric theorems to show
  that a properly configured deep BNN (1) learns the variable importance effectively
  in high dimensions, and its learning rate can sometimes “break” the curse of dimensionality.
  (2) BNN’s uncertainty quantification for variable importance is rigorous, in the
  sense that its 95% credible intervals for variable importance indeed covers the
  truth 95% of the time (i.e. the Bernstein-von Mises (BvM) phenomenon). The theoretical
  results suggest a simple variable selection algorithm based on the BNN’s credible
  intervals. Extensive simulation confirms the theoretical findings and shows that
  the proposed algorithm outperforms existing classic and neural-network-based variable
  selection methods, particularly in high dimensions. "
