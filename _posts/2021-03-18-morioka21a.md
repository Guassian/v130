title: " Independent Innovation Analysis for Nonlinear Vector Autoregressive Process "
abstract: " The nonlinear vector autoregressive (NVAR) model provides an appealing
  framework to analyze multivariate time series obtained from a nonlinear dynamical
  system. However, the innovation (or error), which plays a key role by driving the
  dynamics, is almost always assumed to be additive. Additivity greatly limits the
  generality of the model, hindering analysis of general NVAR processes which have
  nonlinear interactions between the innovations. Here, we propose a new general framework
  called independent innovation analysis (IIA), which estimates the innovations from
  completely general NVAR. We assume mutual independence of the innovations as well
  as their modulation by an auxiliary variable (which is often taken as the time index
  and simply interpreted as nonstationarity). We show that IIA guarantees the identifiability
  of the innovations with arbitrary nonlinearities, up to a permutation and component-wise
  invertible nonlinearities. We also propose three estimation frameworks depending
  on the type of the auxiliary variable. We thus provide the first rigorous identifiability
  result for general NVAR, as well as very general tools for learning such models. "
