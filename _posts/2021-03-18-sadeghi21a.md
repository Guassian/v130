title: " Differentially Private Monotone Submodular Maximization Under Matroid and
  Knapsack Constraints "
abstract: " Numerous tasks in machine learning and artificial intelligence have been
  modeled as submodular maximization problems. These problems usually involve sensitive
  data about individuals, and in addition to maximizing the utility, privacy concerns
  should be considered. In this paper, we study the general framework of non-negative
  monotone submodular maximization subject to matroid or knapsack constraints in both
  offline and online settings. For the offline setting, we propose a differentially
  private $(1-\\frac{\\kappa}{e})$-approximation algorithm, where $\\kappa\\in[0,1]$
  is the total curvature of the submodular set function, which improves upon prior
  works in terms of approximation guarantee and query complexity under the same privacy
  budget. In the online setting, we propose the first differentially private algorithm,
  and we specify the conditions under which the regret bound scales as $Ã˜(\\sqrt{T})$,
  i.e., privacy could be ensured while maintaining the same regret bound as the optimal
  regret guarantee in the non-private setting. "
