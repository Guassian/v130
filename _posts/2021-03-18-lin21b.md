title: " On the Privacy Properties of GAN-generated Samples "
abstract: " The privacy implications of generative adversarial networks (GANs) are
  a topic of great interest, leading to several recent algorithms for training GANs
  with privacy guarantees. By drawing connections to the generalization properties
  of GANs, we prove that under some assumptions, GAN-generated samples inherently
  satisfy some (weak) privacy guarantees. First, we show that if a GAN is trained
  on m samples and used to generate n samples, the generated samples are (epsilon,
  delta)-differentially-private for (epsilon, delta) pairs where delta scales as O(n/m).
  We show that under some special conditions, this upper bound is tight. Next, we
  study the robustness of GAN-generated samples to membership inference attacks. We
  model membership inference as a hypothesis test in which the adversary must determine
  whether a given sample was drawn from the training dataset or from the underlying
  data distribution. We show that this adversary can achieve an area under the ROC
  curve that scales no better than O(m^{-1/4}). "
