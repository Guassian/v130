title: " Model updating after interventions paradoxically introduces bias "
abstract: " Machine learning is increasingly being used to generate prediction models
  for use in a number of real-world settings, from credit risk assessment to clinical
  decision support. Recent discussions have highlighted potential problems in the
  updating of a predictive score for a binary outcome when an existing predictive
  score forms part of the standard workflow, driving interventions. In this setting,
  the existing score induces an additional causative pathway which leads to miscalibration
  when the original score is replaced. We propose a general causal framework to describe
  and address this problem, and demonstrate an equivalent formulation as a partially
  observed Markov decision process. We use this model to demonstrate the impact of
  such ‘naive updating’ when performed repeatedly. Namely, we show that successive
  predictive scores may converge to a point where they predict their own effect, or
  may eventually tend toward a stable oscillation between two values, and we argue
  that neither outcome is desirable. Furthermore, we demonstrate that even if model-fitting
  procedures improve, actual performance may worsen. We complement these findings
  with a discussion of several potential routes to overcome these issues. "
