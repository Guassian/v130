title: " Random Coordinate Underdamped Langevin Monte Carlo "
abstract: " The Underdamped Langevin Monte Carlo (ULMC) is a popular Markov chain
  Monte Carlo sampling method. It requires the computation of the full gradient of
  the log-density at each iteration, an expensive operation if the dimension of the
  problem is high. We propose a sampling method called Random Coordinate ULMC (RC-ULMC),
  which selects a single coordinate at each iteration to be updated and leaves the
  other coordinates untouched. We investigate the computational complexity of RC-ULMC
  and compare it with the classical ULMC for strongly log-concave probability distributions.
  We show that RC-ULMC is always cheaper than the classical ULMC, with a significant
  cost reduction when the problem is highly skewed and high dimensional. Our complexity
  bound for RC-ULMC is also tight in terms of dimension dependence. "
