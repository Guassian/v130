title: " Algorithms for Fairness in Sequential Decision Making "
abstract: " It has recently been shown that if feedback effects of decisions are ignored,
  then imposing fairness constraints such as demographic parity or equality of opportunity
  can actually exacerbate unfairness. We propose to address this challenge by modeling
  feedback effects as Markov decision processes (MDPs). First, we propose analogs
  of fairness properties for the MDP setting. Second, we propose algorithms for learning
  fair decision-making policies for MDPs. Finally, we demonstrate the need to account
  for dynamical effects using simulations on a loan applicant MDP. "
