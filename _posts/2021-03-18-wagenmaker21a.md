title: " Experimental Design for Regret Minimization in Linear Bandits "
abstract: " In this paper we propose a novel experimental design-based algorithm to
  minimize regret in online stochastic linear and combinatorial bandits. While existing
  literature tends to focus on optimism-based algorithms–which have been shown to
  be suboptimal in many cases–our approach carefully plans which action to take by
  balancing the tradeoff between information gain and reward, overcoming the failures
  of optimism. In addition, we leverage tools from the theory of suprema of empirical
  processes to obtain regret guarantees that scale with the Gaussian width of the
  action set, avoiding wasteful union bounds. We provide state-of-the-art finite time
  regret guarantees and show that our algorithm can be applied in both the bandit
  and semi-bandit feedback regime. In the combinatorial semi-bandit setting, we show
  that our algorithm is computationally efficient and relies only on calls to a linear
  maximization oracle. In addition, we show that with slight modification our algorithm
  can be used for pure exploration, obtaining state-of-the-art pure exploration guarantees
  in the semi-bandit setting. Finally, we provide, to the best of our knowledge, the
  first example where optimism fails in the semi-bandit regime, and show that in this
  setting our algorithm succeeds. "
