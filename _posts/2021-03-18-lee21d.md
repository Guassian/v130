title: " Online Model Selection for Reinforcement Learning with Function Approximation "
abstract: " Deep reinforcement learning has achieved impressive successes yet often
  requires a very large amount of interaction data. This result is perhaps unsurprising,
  as using complicated function approximation often requires more data to fit, and
  early theoretical results on linear Markov decision processes provide regret bounds
  that scale with the dimension of the linear approximation. Ideally, we would like
  to automatically identify the minimal dimension of the approximation that is sufficient
  to encode an optimal policy. Towards this end, we consider the problem of model
  selection in RL with function approximation, given a set of candidate RL algorithms
  with known regret guarantees. The learnerâ€™s goal is to adapt to the complexity of
  the optimal algorithm without knowing it a priori. We present a meta-algorithm that
  successively rejects increasingly complex models using a simple statistical test.
  Given at least one candidate that satisfies realizability, we prove the meta-algorithm
  adapts to the optimal complexity with regret that is only marginally suboptimal
  in the number of episodes and number of candidate algorithms. The dimension and
  horizon dependencies remain optimal with respect to the best candidate, and our
  meta-algorithmic approach is flexible to incorporate multiple candidate algorithms
  and models. Finally, we show that the meta-algorithm automatically admits significantly
  improved instance-dependent regret bounds that depend on the gaps between the maximal
  values attainable by the candidates. "
