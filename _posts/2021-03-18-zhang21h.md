title: " Animal pose estimation from video data with a hierarchical von Mises-Fisher-Gaussian
  model "
abstract: " Animal pose estimation from video data is an important step in many biological
  studies, but current methods struggle in complex environments where occlusions are
  common and training data is scarce. Recent work has demonstrated improved accuracy
  with deep neural networks, but these methods often do not incorporate prior distributions
  that could improve localization. Here we present GIMBAL: a hierarchical von Mises-Fisher-Gaussian
  model that improves upon deep networks’ estimates by leveraging spatiotemporal constraints.
  The spatial constraints come from the animal’s skeleton, which induces a curved
  manifold of keypoint configurations. The temporal constraints come from the postural
  dynamics, which govern how angles between keypoints change over time. Importantly,
  the conditional conjugacy of the model permits simple and efficient Bayesian inference
  algorithms. We assess the model on a unique experimental dataset with video of a
  freely-behaving rodent from multiple viewpoints and ground-truth motion capture
  data for 20 keypoints. GIMBAL extends existing techniques, and in doing so offers
  more accurate estimates of keypoint positions, especially in challenging contexts. "
