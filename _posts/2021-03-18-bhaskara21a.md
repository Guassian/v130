title: " Principal Component Regression with Semirandom Observations via Matrix Completion "
abstract: " Principal Component Regression (PCR) is a popular method for prediction
  from data, and is one way to address the so-called multi-collinearity problem in
  regression. It was shown recently that algorithms for PCR such as hard singular
  value thresholding (HSVT) are also quite robust, in that they can handle data that
  has missing or noisy covariates. However, such spectral approaches require strong
  distributional assumptions on which entries are observed. Specifically, every covariate
  is assumed to be observed with probability (exactly) $p$, for some value of $p$.
  Our goal in this work is to weaken this requirement, and as a step towards this,
  we study a “semi-random” model. In this model, every covariate is revealed with
  probability $p$, and then an adversary comes in and reveals additional covariates.
  While the model seems intuitively easier, it is well known that algorithms such
  as HSVT perform poorly. Our approach is based on studying the closely related problem
  of Noisy Matrix Completion in a semi-random setting. By considering a new semidefinite
  programming relaxation, we develop new guarantees for matrix completion, which is
  our core technical contribution. "
