title: " Dual Principal Component Pursuit for Learning a Union of Hyperplanes: Theory
  and Algorithms "
abstract: " State-of-the-art subspace clustering methods are based on convex formulations
  whose theoretical guarantees require the subspaces to be low-dimensional. Dual Principal
  Component Pursuit (DPCP) is a non-convex method that is specifically designed for
  learning high-dimensional subspaces, such as hyperplanes. However, existing analyses
  of DPCP in the multi-hyperplane case lack a precise characterization of the distribution
  of the data and involve quantities that are difficult to interpret. Moreover, the
  provable algorithm based on recursive linear programming is not efficient. In this
  paper, we introduce a new notion of geometric dominance, which explicitly captures
  the distribution of the data, and derive both geometric and probabilistic conditions
  under which a global solution to DPCP is a normal vector to a geometrically dominant
  hyperplane. We then prove that the DPCP problem for a union of hyperplanes satisfies
  a Riemannian regularity condition, and use this result to show that a scalable Riemannian
  subgradient method exhibits (local) linear convergence to the normal vector of the
  geometrically dominant hyperplane. Finally, we show that integrating DPCP into popular
  subspace clustering schemes, such as K-ensembles, leads to superior or competitive
  performance over the state-of-the-art in clustering hyperplanes. "
